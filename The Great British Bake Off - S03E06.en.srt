00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Up until last week, the recipe for a successful bake off was simple - 

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,240
two judges, three challengers, a couple of perimenopausal numpties 

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,040
and a set of strictly adhered to rules. 

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,880
But then the mother of all lime pies was created, 

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,960
- and suddenly, there was a whisk in the works.
- Very good! 

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,040
Because in baking, literally anything can happen. 

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,520
Welcome to the Great British Bake Off. 

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,040
Last week... 

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,360
This is coming out in about...56 seconds. 

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,280
Pies proved to be Manisha's downfall. 

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,200
Sarah Jane just clung on. 

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,800
SHE GASPS 

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,160
It's out! It's out, it's out, it's out! 

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,440
And against all the odds... 

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,720
You've absolutely nailed that. 

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,200
Ryan's stunning key lime pie snatched Star Baker. 

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,960
I didn't realise it was that good. 

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,320
- This week... 
- My strudel's got a haemorrhage. 

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,600
..seven bakers tuck into pudding... 

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,560
I'm just prepping my cloots. 

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,520
..with a Royal technical challenge. 

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,600
Mine's not browning at all. 

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,080
A Showstopper that will stretch them to breaking point. 

24
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,320
OK, I was worried for second. I've calmed down now. 

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,280
And the hardest decision Mary and Paul have ever made. 

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,920
- It's tough.
- I know. 

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,960
The rain clouds are a sign of impending doom. 

28
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,000
So this week, I'm thinking something hot, I'm thinking something spongy. 

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,800
I'm thinking something saucy, 

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,360
I'm thinking something with a little bit of bite, but mainly just...ooze. 

31
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,320
I think you should just take that into your personal life, Mel. 

32
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,320
I don't want to hear about it. There's a dating website you can use. 

33
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,440
Just go for it. It's pudding week. 

34
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,760
Bakers, welcome to yet another beautiful summer's day here in the marquee, 

35
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,160
and you, the Magnificent Seven. 

36
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,960
But, of course, we'll be losing one of you at the weekend 

37
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,480
and there are still three more challenges to come, 

38
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,200
the first of which is, of course, the Signature Bake. 

39
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,160
We'd like you to make two different flavoured sponges, 

40
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,760
please, with two different accompaniments. 

41
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,080
They should be individual-sized portions, please, 

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,760
and they can be baked, boiled or steamed. 

43
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,960
You've got two hours to do this challenge, 

44
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,040
- so on your marks...
- Get set... 
- Bake! 

45
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,920
A sponge pudding is a quintessentially British dessert, 

46
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,240
consisting of a light sponge that is usually 

47
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,280
accompanied by a sticky topping, custard or ice cream. 

48
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,960
I feel a bit panicky already, which is not a good way to start. 

49
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,160
The bakers have been asked to produce two varieties. 

50
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,720
Six of one, six of another with two different sauces. 

51
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,120
How simple is that? 

52
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,160
If we can't knock a couple of sponge puddings up in two hours, 

53
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,360
then we don't deserve the accolade of even being here. 

54
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,240
They've got to be not under baked, so it's got a gooey middle, 

55
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,040
and not over baked so they're so dry. 

56
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,320
So they've got to pitch it just right. 

57
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,000
Perfecting two recipes is hard enough, 

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,760
but doing both at the same time 

59
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,560
makes this the most demanding Signature Challenge the bakers have yet to face. 

60
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,200
The judges are making the challenges harder and harder. 

61
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,360
To do this in the first week would have sent us all into a frenzy. 

62
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,880
It's coming towards the second half of the competition, you know, you can't play safe any more. 

63
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,800
You just have to do your best dish. 

64
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,280
If it involves making risky dishes, so be it. 

65
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,640
Dad-of-two Ryan has so far found texture troubling. 

66
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,440
It's a little solid for me. 

67
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,760
Has struggled in the technical challenges. 

68
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,000
It's a bit scrambled egg like inside. 

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,280
- But has often impressed with flavour.
- Sheer perfection. 

70
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,880
For his signature puddings, 

71
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,040
he's making chocolate fondant with sticky ginger and date pudding. 

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,440
Fruit can inhibit the sponge's rise, 

73
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,440
so he's trying to give it an extra lift. 

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,320
- I'm using both bicarb and baking powder.
- And what kind of flour? 

75
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,800
- I'm using self raising.
- Why are you using three raising agents? 

76
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,680
It's just a recipe I picked up a long time ago, 

77
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,160
so I don't want to play with something that's traditional. 

78
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,000
Doesn't sound very traditional to have three raising agents. 

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,240
You would normally add plain flour and then the other raising agents. 

80
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,520
- Right.
- Well, we'll see. 
- Last week's Star Baker. 

81
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,320
You've got a lot to live up to. 

82
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,520
These are dates and they're going to go in the banoffee pudding. 

83
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,080
I've actually got some really nice Cavendish banana as well, 

84
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,760
which is, kind of, slow-dried banana. 

85
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,600
So that looks a bit like the dates, but it adds a much richer flavour. 

86
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,000
If the flavour combinations don't go down well, I'm a bit stuck. 

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,840
Intensive care consultant Danny has quietly emerged 

88
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,840
as one of the Bake Off's strongest contenders... 

89
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,000
That's quite something. 

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,880
- ..excelling with flavour... 
- They're fantastic, really good. 

91
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,680
- ..and presentation. 
- That's impressive layers. 

92
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,720
Her banoffee puddings will be topped with a walnut butterscotch sauce 

93
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,680
and she's adding orange extract for her twist 

94
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,840
on a classic chocolate fondant. 

95
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:38,240
- Are you good multitasker, Danny? I sense you are.
- I am in some respects. 

96
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,600
It is a bit of a cliche, isn't it, that women multitask more easily? 

97
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,880
Yeah, Catherine and Sarah Jane have both said to me - 

98
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,440
I'm sandwiched between them - "Don't let the side down." 

99
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,440
I was like, "What do you mean?" They were like, "More of them than us, do not let the side down." 

100
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,680
What's happening? There's a bit of sort of... 

101
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,960
- All the girls on this side and all the boys on that side. 
- I know. 

102
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,040
HE HUMS 

103
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,840
I haven't gone in for any fancy tricks. 

104
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,920
The rhubarb and ginger's a classic combination, 

105
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,960
but the strawberry adds another dimension to it 

106
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,600
and it rests on top of this very lovely sponge mixture 

107
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,280
with lots of crystallised ginger in it. 

108
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,280
So far, retired recruitment consultant Brendan 

109
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,840
has rarely put a foot wrong. 

110
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,080
Really well baked. 

111
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,840
I like the structure, I like the flavour, it's unique. 

112
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,560
- It's something we've never seen before.
- Oh! 

113
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,480
As well as his signature rhubarb, strawberry and ginger puddings, 

114
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,760
he's making a classic sticky toffee pudding, flavoured with rum. 

115
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,680
Technically you have been very strong. 

116
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,160
Your knowledge has been quite staggering, 

117
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,280
I've been impressed with what you've known. 

118
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,760
When it comes to puddings, though, would you say this was one of your strengths or weaknesses? 

119
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,960
I wouldn't say it was a strength because I only make them occasionally. 

120
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,400
If I'm giving dinners, I would prefer to do desserts. 

121
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,320
I'm trying to concentrate on delivering authentic flavours 

122
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,320
in the authentic way, rather than trying to be inventive. 

123
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,000
So we won't be seeing any molecular gastronomy from you? No nitrogen oxide? 

124
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,880
Heston Blumenthal has a lot to answer for. 

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Brendan, Sarah-Jane and John 

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,280
have all chosen to make a classic sticky toffee pudding. 

127
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,440
I try not to think about what everybody else is doing, to be honest. 

128
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,880
For their base, they're all combining the simple brown sugar sponge mix 

129
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,880
with the traditional dates and golden syrup. 

130
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,000
Everyone likes a good sticky toff, well, I hope they do! 

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,800
But John has taken things a step further. 

132
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,840
I've got Lady Grey tea. 

133
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,480
You usually soak the dates in some water, but I'm soaking mine 

134
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,440
in Lady Grey tea just to give it a bit of a spicy flavour. 

135
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,120
Law student John's passion for baking... 

136
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,800
Felt like he cut through my heart. 

137
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,240
- ..has seen him claim Star Baker. 
- The flavours are lovely. 

138
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,160
- Absolutely lovely.
- And never allow criticism to deter him. 

139
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,440
It looks like a chocolate breezeblock. 

140
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,360
I wanted it to be a robust, dark cake. 

141
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,120
His spicy sticky toffee pudding will be accompanied by 

142
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,800
a raspberry and white chocolate pudding, enriched with mascarpone. 

143
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,560
- You don't seem to let it get to you that much.
- Well, it's baking, 

144
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,920
and it means a hell of a lot of me and I'd love to win this. 

145
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,600
But if you're going to fail in life, 

146
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,240
- hope it's in your work and not in your family life. 
- No, that's very sensible. 

147
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,760
- But having said all that, you'd love to win?
- Oh gosh, yeah! 

148
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,320
So much so, I've already tried to trip Brendan up a few times. 

149
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,040
But that man is infallible. He's like a machine. I'm sure he's the Terminator 

150
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,720
- I know. He is. He's the Bake-inator. 
- The Bake-inator!
- Isn't he? 

151
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,040
I'm a bit all over the place this morning. 

152
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,760
I think because there's two different recipes, 

153
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,680
there's a lot of ingredients about. 

154
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,200
Trying to remember what goes on where, at what time. 

155
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,200
It's just kind of getting me a bit...confused. 

156
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,440
Mum-of-two Sarah-Jane 

157
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,720
has been steadily building on a series of successful bakes... 

158
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,120
I really enjoyed it. It's unique, it's very different. 

159
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,240
That tastes absolutely delicious. 

160
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,680
..until the pressure in the marquee... 

161
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,120
Oh, my God Almighty. 

162
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,160
..began to tell. 

163
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,200
It's the worst thing I've probably ever made. 

164
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,840
She's attempting to get back on track with a sticky toffee pudding 

165
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,760
and another of her family's favourites. 

166
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,920
- I've got my granny's saucy lemon puddings.
- You've used Granny's recipes before, haven't you? 

167
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,680
- I have, yes. 
- Did she teach you to cook? 

168
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,880
She was always cooking something. They lived in a big farmhouse 

169
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,160
and she was always making pastry and, you know, puddings and stuff like that around. 

170
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,800
So there's a lot of my cooking memories are to do with my granny. 

171
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,120
Sometimes your techniques let you down a bit, 

172
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,720
but flavours have always been there. 

173
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,520
The bakers are all using bain-maries. 

174
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,800
The steam created during baking prevents their puddings from forming an unacceptable crust. 

175
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,240
But James' puddings require a little extra protection. 

176
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,280
I'm just prepping my cloots. 

177
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,880
These bits of muslin are what the... 

178
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,600
clootie dumplings are going to be boiled in. 

179
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,480
Medical student James has consistently experimented. 

180
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,120
- I love that! 
- And impressed with flavour... 

181
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,280
I like the lavender and I think you have really conquered that. 

182
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,360
..and innovative techniques. 

183
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
Fascinating. I mean, it really is. 

184
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,840
He is making his signature banana puddings with home-brewed beer 

185
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,120
and a Scottish classic - rich fruity clootie dumplings. 

186
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,200
Flour the muslin before you put the clootie in. 

187
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,440
And what that does is when it cooks, it creates a skin. 

188
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,680
It doesn't sound all that appetising, a skin over the clootie. 

189
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,200
That keeps it fresh. I'm not really feeling anxious about this one. 

190
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,840
It's, as far as I'm concerned, a very safe one to play because it is very nice. 

191
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,400
Bakers, headline news - you have got ten minutes with your sponges. 

192
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,960
Oh, stress! Why am I stressed? Just baking. 

193
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,760
For checking the time on my timer because I, um, didn't set it 

194
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,160
but I remembered I didn't set it, 

195
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,520
so it's not coming out in one minute, but I was checking. 

196
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,000
And I'll check it in one minute. 

197
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,480
But they're not ready come out. I need a small saucepan. 

198
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,480
Mum-of-two Cathryn 

199
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,320
has frequently doubted her natural baking talent. 

200
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,840
Oh, it's terrible, isn't it? 

201
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,960
- But all too often... 
- It's beautifully moist. 

202
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,520
- ..she's proved herself wrong. 
- Yes!
- Oh, hello!
- Get in there! 

203
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,800
She's running out of time trying to complete her chocolate walnut whipped puddings 

204
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,840
filled with Italian meringue and her elderflower sponges, topped with clotted cream rice pudding. 

205
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,360
Three things going on at the same time there. 

206
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,680
Pouring, dipping, mixing and also baking. That's actually four things. 

207
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,440
- I learnt a big lesson from that. Sorry, I'm coming back.
- Yes. 

208
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,640
I'm just ushering the spoon. Here we go. Ushering the spoon. Good. 

209
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,800
Yep, my oven's beeping. 

210
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,880
Ooh, look at those! 

211
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,760
They look good! 

212
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,240
OK, it's a pud alert. 

213
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,760
You've got five minutes, bakers! 

214
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,320
Delicious, hot muslin parcels. 

215
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,080
- There's the clootie.
- Oh, it's a wee bit soft. 

216
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,400
- OK. Is that all right? 
- No, not really. 

217
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,000
There's a little dip there as well, 

218
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,440
which is a good indication that it's moistened slightly, 

219
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,960
so hopefully I got the right balance today. 

220
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,400
I don't think I floured it enough. 

221
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,040
There should be a skin of flour around the outside. 

222
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:44,000
Look at the state of me. My hand is shaking. My... Oh, my giddy aunt 

223
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,800
Oh! Oh, no! 

224
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,440
- Can I help you, Danny? 
- Yeah, I've got some more mixture. 

225
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,440
It just fell off when I was taking them out of the oven. 

226
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,280
I could cry. 

227
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,640
Let's put these in here. 

228
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,960
It's ruined. Absolutely ruined. I'm so going out. 

229
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,200
Danny, my love, you got four good sponges. 

230
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,440
Yeah, I haven't got six to present to them. 

231
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,160
- Two fell on the floor. I've got it all down my shoe.
- Don't panic. 

232
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,600
You've got two more in the oven. That's good. 

233
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,280
Come on. I think this is going to happen with all of them. 

234
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,200
Bakers, you have got one minute. 

235
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,240
That side out! 

236
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,400
OK, bakers. Time is up on your hot, comforting sponges. 

237
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,360
Please step right away from them. Thank you. 

238
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,320
I am waiting to be mauled by Paul, actually. 

239
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,040
I'm going out. 

240
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,960
It's that tight. 

241
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,800
There's no way I can pull this back. 

242
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,320
Did you cook these sticky toffee puddings 

243
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,720
with some toffee sauce on the top of it 

244
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,640
- or did you put it on when it came out?
- I put it on when it came out 

245
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,840
and then I did a bit of blowtorching on it 

246
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,280
to have it bubble up a bit. 

247
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,560
You've crystallised the toffee, haven't you? It's quite grainy. 

248
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,200
I did it with the blowtorch. 

249
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,160
I don't think I would go to the lengths of blowtorch. 

250
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,320
I don't think it's necessary. 

251
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,200
I don't think it improves it because it changes the texture of it. 

252
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,880
Right. 

253
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,600
Actually, the strawberries really works with it. 

254
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,280
And the ginger is lovely. Mm. That is a perfect creme anglaise. 

255
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,960
- It's a good sponge too.
- With a quote "perfect creme anglaise". 

256
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,840
- Pretty good.
- Thanks very much. 
- Thank you. 

257
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,800
The lemon isn't actually coming through strongly, 

258
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,520
and I was expecting a little bit of sauce at the bottom. 

259
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,880
As a souffle it's very good. As a sponge? Very different. 

260
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,520
- Not quite a sponge. 
- OK.
- That is not a sponge. 

261
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,120
I've totally broken the rules. I can be eliminated. 

262
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,360
It's got some lovely flavours in there. 

263
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,320
- It's a little on the dry side, a little overbaked.
- OK. 

264
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,080
Can I disagree with you, Mary? I think the opposite. 

265
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,040
I think it's actually all right. 

266
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,640
I wanted to check with that one, because you've got a big load 

267
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,440
of moisture in there, which is why it holds and wets the finger. 

268
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,600
- Right. OK. Is that a good thing? 
- Yep.
- OK.
- Yeah. 

269
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,800
They look indulgent. 

270
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,200
Not as light as I thought it was going to be. 

271
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,160
It's got a very dry texture. The flavour's OK. Right. 

272
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,320
To me there's too much raising agent in there. 

273
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,640
It's a bitter taste at the end 

274
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,760
and I didn't taste the brandy sauce with it 

275
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,840
because I wanted to make sure. 

276
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,840
- These look impressive, actually. 
- You're totally original on this. 

277
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,680
- Yeah.
- Totally something different. 

278
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,640
The rice is undercooked. 

279
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,400
- Oh.
- Al dente. 

280
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,320
- It's not a good thing on that. 
- I'm sorry. I know it's not my job. 

281
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,240
I have to butt in and say I think that rice is cooked. 

282
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,120
- I think the rice is cooked.
- Sorry. 

283
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,800
(Thank you.) 

284
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,400
- You don't like those either? 
- That's too dry. 

285
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,480
OK. 

286
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,360
They're a little bit solid. 

287
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,320
But you're getting away with it because you've put a meringue there, 

288
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,280
and if you had lots of ice cream with it, it would be fine. 

289
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,920
But what a clever idea, what a good presentation. 

290
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,760
Just get that sponge a little bit lighter next time. 

291
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,400
You've got a lot of white chocolate in there and raspberries. 

292
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,720
It's quite solid, but that's because you've got so much fruit in it. 

293
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,960
- Sponge is bland.
- Bland?
- Absolutely. 

294
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,600
If you never had anything else with it you might as well be 

295
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,440
chewing on a piece of card. 

296
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,920
- Wow, that's a bit harsh.
- Honestly. 

297
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,800
Mm. That's very moist. And you've got the topping just right. 

298
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,120
- How could you refuse that?
- Kicking with flavour. Well done.
- Thank you. 

299
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,320
That's proper. I think that first one needs a lot of work. 

300
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,520
Now, this one, clootie. 

301
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,160
I think it's very nice that almost everything you do, 

302
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,520
you bring from Scotland, including your temper. 

303
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,320
It's too much of a chew, do you know what I mean? 

304
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,560
The texture's not right on the outside. 

305
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,120
I feel the ratio of topping to the amount of sponge we've got, 

306
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,800
I'd like to see more of the topping. 

307
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,240
It's a beautifully made sponge. It tastes fantastic. 

308
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,120
All the favours are coming through but it does need a little bit more sauce. 

309
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,560
Danny, accidents happen, don't they? 

310
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,920
Only too often in my kitchen. 

311
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,120
We'll start by cutting into these. 

312
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,920
I really like them. The flavour's there and the texture's excellent. 

313
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,560
I think they are slightly overbaked for me. 

314
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,760
- That is a very moist sponge. 
- Thank you. 

315
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,200
That's delicious. 

316
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,160
Orange comes through really sharp and strong and tangy. 

317
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,240
Both of them taste extremely good but just be careful of your bake. 

318
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,400
Thank you very much. 

319
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,080
I can't say anything more than how decent they were about it because they were. 

320
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,920
They were both very, very decent. 

321
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,560
I couldn't have hoped for better really. That was great. 

322
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,080
What annoyed me most is that I think they went in there ready to give me a good kicking 

323
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,880
because I put three different raising agents inside, yeah. 

324
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,320
I don't think it made that much difference to the bake. 

325
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,640
Not great, no. It wasn't great at all. I haven't had great for weeks. 

326
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,840
I was hoping to kind of up it a bit this week 

327
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,880
but it hasn't happened so far. 

328
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,720
When we think of puddings, we think of hearty, suet-y, stodgy, arterially cloggy, 

329
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,280
but once upon a time, when wealthy diners wanted to satisfy their sugar cravings, 

330
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,000
they did so by using an art form that required its very own kitchen, the confectionery, 

331
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,600
and working inside was the sugar wizard they called the confectioner. 

332
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,760
In some stately homes like Syon House in Middlesex, 

333
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,600
wealthy aristocrats of the 18th and 19th century 

334
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,400
had whole kitchens built called confectioneries, 

335
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,000
where the most ornate and elaborate of puddings 

336
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,240
would've been created by a craftsman of sugar called the confectioner. 

337
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,600
Confectioners would've commanded huge sums of money 

338
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,320
to whip up sugary sensations to form the piece de resistance 

339
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,960
of any aristocratic banquet. 

340
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,880
Who are you looking at? 

341
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,520
Having one's own confectioner was a real mark of wealth, 

342
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,840
something the third Duke of Northumberland had in abundance, 

343
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,440
along with a penchant for puddings. 

344
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,720
Kitchens in great houses were usually detached from the main block, 

345
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,840
in this case because of the instant consumption 

346
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,240
of these particular items. 

347
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,840
A small confectioner's kitchen was placed within the bounds of the house, which was slightly unusual. 

348
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,800
So the Duke was such a pudding fan 

349
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,480
that he couldn't wait for the desserts to be transported 

350
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,040
from an out building, they had to be right there 

351
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,840
so that he could click his fingers and suddenly, meringue tower. 

352
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,960
Very likely, yes. 

353
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,800
What about the confectioners themselves, 

354
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,960
- were they well looked after? 
- Very well indeed. 

355
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,080
A confectioner would have been highly valued 

356
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,880
and there would have been competition to procure his services. 

357
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,200
They were very highly paid, more so than any other servant. 

358
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,040
The confectioner himself 

359
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,080
undoubtedly would've had a separate suite of rooms just for himself. 

360
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,080
The confectionery contained all the equipment, 

361
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,400
ovens and moulds for the confectioner to conjure up 

362
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,160
not only hot sponges and desserts but cutting-edge creations. 

363
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,840
The ultimate accolade would be to produce an iced cabinet pudding. 

364
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,360
The original cabinet pudding was a steamed pudding, 

365
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,320
which was made with leftover sponge cake in between layers of custard 

366
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,880
and raisins or other dried fruit. 

367
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,240
This is an iced cabinet pudding, 

368
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,760
which is a wonderful French micky take 

369
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,960
of our stodgy kind of puddings made of waste bread 

370
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,640
and boring old bits of dried cake. 

371
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,680
And the French have taken the same ingredients but turned it into 

372
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:47,520
this wonderful little caprice of ice cream and ginger and sponge cake. 

373
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,360
If it's just made out of bits of old sponge, 

374
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,320
why is it so difficult to make? 

375
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,080
It's not really difficult now cos we have freezers and fridges 

376
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,440
but they didn't in the early 19th century. 

377
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,520
You needed an icehouse, 

378
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,400
which was a major building project. 

379
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,320
You then had to get your gardeners to collect ice off the lake 

380
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,400
during the winter. 

381
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,240
It involved a tremendous amount of work. 

382
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,840
'Despite being conceived by the French to poke fun 

383
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,480
'at our stodgy puddings, 

384
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,720
'this decadent creation actually became incredibly popular 

385
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,560
'in 19th-century Britain, 

386
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,480
'giving aristocratic diners the last laugh.' 

387
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,440
I think it looks very elegant. I'm about to destroy its elegance 

388
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,760
with a big spoon. 

389
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,200
Right, OK, I can wait no longer. 

390
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,720
Here we go. 

391
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,960
Mm. 

392
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,320
I'm certainly getting the sub-zero tang on the filling. 

393
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,200
That is delicious! 

394
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,600
Nice, isn't it? 

395
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,200
If I was a duchess, which I'm not - which may come as a surprise(!), 

396
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,440
I would pretty much lock you in here 24/7. 

397
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,400
I'd give you your own suite of rooms, but you couldn't go anywhere. 

398
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,080
That is too good! 

399
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,960
No wonder they were so prized. 

400
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,720
'Pudding is about to become a little less pleasurable.' 

401
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,600
So, bakers, it's time for the second challenge 

402
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,560
of this bake off. 

403
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,080
And it is, of course, the Technical Challenge. 

404
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,280
You know the drill. 

405
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:13,440
Mary and Paul will judge this blind so please, Mary and Paul... 

406
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,400
With great respect and love, please leave. 

407
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,800
What we'd like you to make is... 

408
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,880
Queen of Puddings. 

409
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,440
Now, Queen of Puddings 

410
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,200
is layers of baked custard and jam 

411
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,720
topped with a chewy meringue. 

412
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,600
This recipe, no pressure(!), 

413
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,640
comes from the queen of puddings, Mary Berry. 

414
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,280
So, if you get it wrong, 

415
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,200
it's sort of an act of treason 

416
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,680
and she will be mounting your head on a cocktail stick, 

417
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,640
and then dusting you with icing sugar. 

418
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,880
- On your marks.
- Get set. 

419
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,160
Good luck, and bake! 

420
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,000
- Did you know that?
- Yeah. 

421
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,800
'To master the Queen of Puddings is a juggling act 

422
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,880
'requiring the dexterity of a court jester.' 

423
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,920
LAUGHTER 

424
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,720
'Custard, jam and meringue should come together 

425
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,560
'in three distinct layers, 

426
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,680
'rather than one "royal" mess.' 

427
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,000
There's always a certain amount of dread 

428
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,720
that you'll make a prat of yourself of the Technical Challenge. 

429
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,560
'The bakers each have a copy of the basic recipe, 

430
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,400
'but some of the technical details have been omitted.' 

431
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,000
You kind of just have to draw 

432
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,160
on everything you know about, ever, 

433
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,080
in the space of five minutes. 

434
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,240
There's a few things worrying me. Never made custard before. 

435
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,280
Never made jam before. 

436
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,400
Erm, that worries me a lot. 

437
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,880
I don't know... 

438
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,040
The Queen of Pudding. 

439
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,920
I think it's many families' 

440
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,000
favourite pudding, 

441
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,120
and it is quite tricky, 

442
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,160
and you have to get every stage right. 

443
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,000
The custard, for example, 

444
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,160
has got to be cooked at a fairly low temperature 

445
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,880
so it doesn't curdle. 

446
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,320
They'll make their own jam. 

447
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,440
Not too firm - because they won't spread it across the top. 

448
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,840
And then, the meringue. 

449
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,520
That will cause them problems. 

450
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,560
They've got to beat it until it's really, really stiff. 

451
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,200
People are nervous, and end up with rather a runny mixture. 

452
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,320
I want to see nice peaks on the top. 

453
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,840
Oh, listen to that. 

454
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,960
A really nice, crunchy top. 

455
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,200
There you've got the custard layer, 

456
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,800
the jam layer, and lastly, the meringue. 

457
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,080
Mm! 

458
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,560
It's all right that, Mary. 

459
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,440
Glad you're enjoying it. 

460
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,960
The bakers start with their base layer of custard 

461
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,760
by heating milk, butter, 

462
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,080
lemon zest and sugar, 

463
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,360
and gradually whisking it into a bowl, 

464
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,080
with egg yolk. 

465
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,560
There are many elements to this dish. 

466
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,840
Many elements. 

467
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,360
Custard isn't a solid foundation 

468
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,800
for any type of construction, 

469
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,120
so bread crumbs are placed at the bottom of the baking dish for stability. 

470
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,760
"Pour the liquid over the custard, 

471
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,480
"so the breadcrumbs absorb the liquid." Well, that's absorbed. 

472
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,080
It just feels like it won't do 

473
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,520
what it's supposed to do. 

474
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,040
Egg protein 

475
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,680
changes shape when heated, 

476
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,960
and allows the custard to set. 

477
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,600
But if it's heated too long, 

478
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,160
the surface will crack and the custard will be ruined. 

479
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,040
It's just a waiting game now. I have really no idea how long everything will take. 

480
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,000
While the custard's in the oven, 

481
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,040
the bakers need to move onto the next layer. 

482
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,000
"Make the jam." 

483
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,400
That's detailed, isn't Mary(?) "Make the jam." 

484
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,560
The bakers have been given summer fruits and sugar. 

485
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,080
I'm just trying to remember how to make jam! 

486
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,280
It's not supposed to be like a you'd have in a jam jar. 

487
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,240
It's more of a saucy jam. 

488
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,680
They need to make a jam thick enough to clearly separate the custard from the meringue layers... 

489
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,200
I'm going to put it on a low heat and slowly boil the liquid away. 

490
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,600
..but thin enough to spread over the fragile custard skin. 

491
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,480
Every single week in Technical Challenge is a guessing game. 

492
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,080
For me, anyway. 

493
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,960
I'm looking for a soft-set jam. 

494
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,720
So, look, we're nearly there. It's just moving a little bit. 

495
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,360
There are some advantages to being older. 

496
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,640
You learn when the setting point of jam 

497
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,960
is just right. 

498
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,520
Bakers, you've got one hour to go. 

499
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,680
Yes, one hour to go. 45 minutes have gone. 

500
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,160
An hour and 45 minutes isn't long enough. 

501
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,880
The bakers must take their custard out of the oven at the perfect moment. 

502
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,160
No, that is not done. 

503
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,120
Runny. 

504
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,640
Underdone, and it won't carry the weight of the jam. 

505
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,960
I'm going to give that five more and then I'll bring it out. 

506
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,160
Maybe not even five, maybe just four. 

507
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,080
No, because I opened the oven. I'll give it five. 

508
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,800
Overbaked, and it will split. 

509
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,480
What temperature is he, Doctor? 

510
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,680
It's 83, which is very high. 

511
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,840
It's incredibly high. D'you think he'll live? 

512
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,440
Erm, no. 

513
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,200
I don't really want to put the jam on yet. 

514
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,040
If I was at home, 

515
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,960
I'd wait another five or ten minutes, 

516
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,360
but I think it would be worse to run out of time. 

517
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,960
The jam must completely cover the custard, 

518
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,760
without seeping into it. 

519
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,360
That's all right. 

520
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,680
I was worried if I poured the whole lot on, it would just go straight in. 

521
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:16,760
That just looks awful. Mary's going to slap me in the face. 

522
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,080
Perfecting the final layer is even harder. 

523
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,840
Right, meringue. Let's get on it. 

524
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,120
To make meringue, the bakers whisk egg whites to make a foam, 

525
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,000
then add sugar. 

526
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,760
I get a bit scared with egg whites. 

527
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,200
I don't want to over-whip it. 

528
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,080
But I think you need to whip it till it's quite stiff, 

529
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,600
so I'll just keep going. 

530
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,680
Protein molecules in egg white trap air, 

531
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,560
creating the classic stiff peak. 

532
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,760
But over-whisking weakens the molecules, 

533
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,240
causing the air bubbles to burst, 

534
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,600
and the meringue will collapse in the bowl or the oven. 

535
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,760
Oh, God, this is runny. 

536
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,840
Don't put that over my head, please, Ryan. 

537
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,440
I think this is a bit runny 

538
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,600
but it's going to go in there. I won't make another one. 

539
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,240
I think my meringue's gone over. 

540
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,280
It's a bit runny. 

541
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,640
I'm just going to do it again. 

542
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
Bakers! 

543
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,320
You only have half an hour left! 

544
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,920
If I like the look of it, I'll use this one. 

545
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,200
And if I don't, 

546
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,640
I'll go back to my original one. 

547
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,680
The Queen of Puddings should be crowned with tall mountain tops of meringue. 

548
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,400
The bakers are doing their best to get an extra inch. 

549
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Bit disappointed by the meringue. 

550
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,320
It kind of collapsed a bit, it was a bit gooey. 

551
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,520
I was hoping to make it puffier, and then make peaks. 

552
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,840
The judges will demand a light, golden colour 

553
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,520
and crisp surface. 

554
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,480
Please be good. 

555
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,880
That looks better. 

556
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,680
The Queen of Puddings' presence 

557
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,280
is required. 

558
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,560
In 15 minutes. 

559
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,880
The centre of the meringue should have a soft marshmallow texture. 

560
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,200
There's problems, there's issues. 

561
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,680
Mine's not browning 

562
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,080
at all. 

563
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,120
But under-baking will allow the moisture trapped in the egg protein 

564
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,320
to weep into the custard. 

565
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,800
These Technicals, they suck you in. 

566
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,680
You look at the recipe and think, "This should be simple enough.," 

567
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,400
Then you do it and it's like, 

568
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,040
"Oh." 

569
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,600
OK, bakers. 

570
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,880
One minute's left on your monarch's meringues. 

571
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,000
One more minute! 

572
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,400
Get back in there. 

573
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
I've actually had to crank the oven up, 

574
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,080
just to make it go. 

575
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,120
I just want it to be perfect for them. 

576
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,120
But nothing in life is perfect. 

577
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,200
So, bakers, the Technical Challenge is over er. 

578
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,000
- POSH VOICE:
- Please bring your Queen's Puddings up here. 

579
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,600
We chose that dish for you, so you can't hide anything. 

580
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,080
It's got a nice colour on this one. 

581
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,520
A lovely colour on that, 

582
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,200
and they've troubled to pipe it. Listen to that crunch. 

583
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,000
Can you hear? 

584
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,440
That's the crunch, and nice and marshmallow-y inside. 

585
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,680
The layers aren't too bad. 

586
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,480
It's a lovely flavour! 

587
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,560
- A nice crisp top. 
- It's a nice custard, this one. 

588
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,360
Mm-hm. 

589
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,040
What a difference it makes to make your own jam. 

590
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,360
It's got a nice crispy top to this one. 

591
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,960
It needs that height, doesn't it, in the meringue? 

592
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,880
It needs a little bit more whipping. 

593
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,280
Meringue is a funny thing. 

594
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,800
Difficult to over-beat it. It's usually under-beating it. 

595
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,200
Little bit of a crisp, 

596
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,880
bit more marshmallowy in this one. 

597
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,680
Jam's very runny on that one, isn't it? 

598
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,560
Jam's just a bit runny, yes. 

599
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,760
The custard's good. 

600
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,320
Oh, dear. 

601
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,280
Look at that. 

602
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,680
Yes. Now that is an example 

603
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,720
of the custard... 

604
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,880
Custard's gone. 

605
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,240
..overcooking, and that means it's gone watery. 

606
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,520
It tastes all right, but that custard's been obliterated. 

607
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,560
Piping's good. 

608
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,640
At least there's been an attempt to get a bit more height out of it. 

609
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,800
Nice custard. 

610
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,600
Good jam. 

611
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,920
We needed a little more volume. 

612
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,400
Pretty, this one, isn't it? 

613
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,560
It's a good meringue. 

614
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,600
The base is good and the top looks very good. 

615
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,560
Lovely marshmallowy texture. 

616
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,400
Having tasted all the bakes, 

617
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,960
the judges must now rank this Royal Family of puddings, 

618
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,120
from lowest to "Her Highness". 

619
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,760
So, starting off with number seven. 

620
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,520
It's here. 

621
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,640
The custard has separated. 

622
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,360
It is very watery. 

623
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,720
And that affects the jam, 

624
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,160
which mixes with it. 

625
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,000
Number six is this one. 

626
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,880
The jam is a little bit thin up one end. 

627
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,400
I'd like to have seen a bit more height in that meringue. 

628
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,320
John came in at number five, followed by Sarah-Jane 

629
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,360
and Cathryn's queen is third in line to the throne. 

630
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,960
Number two is this one. 

631
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,080
Good meringue, good base. 

632
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,440
And number one. 

633
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,520
- Well done, Brendan. 
- You've done it again. 

634
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,640
What can I say about this one? 

635
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,720
It has really good volume and height from the meringue, 

636
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,080
a perfect colour on top, 

637
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,800
beautiful layers 

638
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,320
sheer perfection and a joy to eat. 

639
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,680
'She couldn't fault it - Mary.' 

640
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,000
If she's often referred to as an "old-fashioned" girl, then I'm an "old-fashioned boy". 

641
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,600
My confidence has grown, so I think I've found my feet. 

642
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,480
Not so good, but it's not as if I haven't been here before. 

643
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,640
'Just have to pull it out of the bag tomorrow, you know,' 

644
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,600
and try to save my bottom. 

645
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,920
Goodness, that wasn't very good, was it? 

646
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,560
It's not very nice to be bottom. 

647
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,600
For one of these seven bakers, the final challenge of the weekend 

648
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,520
will be their last in The Great British Bake Off. 

649
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,280
There are a few people who need to perform because they're in trouble. 

650
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,720
- Paul, who are those people? 
- James - he was bottom of the technical challenge, 

651
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,560
and the flavour of those sponges weren't particularly good, the texture was hard on one of them. 

652
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,440
Ryan had a problem with using too much raising agent. 

653
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,560
- John...
- He has to be in there based on the one thing that he did wrong. 

654
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,120
The sponge was a bit bland. 

655
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,680
Sarah-Jane had an interesting day. 

656
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:06,400
- You'd have to put her in there as well.
- The sponge that she did was not what I would consider a sponge. 

657
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,920
Who's excelling at the moment? 

658
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,600
- Brendan again.
- It's a bit like a stuck record, that. 

659
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,840
- What about Danny?
- Accidents happen to all of us. 

660
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,320
- When you actually tasted that, it was perfect.
- It was delicious. 

661
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,240
It wasn't done, though. 

662
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,760
If you looked at it, even the ones that weren't dropped, 

663
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,800
they had a fat bottom, all mis-shaped, yes, it tasted good... 

664
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,840
Paul, I thought that they were an excellent flavour, 

665
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,200
- the texture was very good... 
- Oh, yeah... 

666
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,440
- ..and also her second bake...
- What about the look of them, though? 

667
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,080
- The look of them, she'd had an accident...
- No, the ones that didn't. 

668
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,320
- There were two that were upright. 
- They weren't, they were lopsided, like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. 

669
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,360
It's getting harder for us, which is why we're arguing 

670
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:51,560
all the time because we're relying now almost on one Showstopper 

671
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,480
to make the decision for us. 

672
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,760
- And it's a really difficult one this time.
- Look at the smile. 
- Absolutely marvellous. 

673
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,640
Whoa-ho-ho-hah! 

674
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,880
Today, we're going to ask you to bake that Austrian classic - 

675
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,120
the strudel. 

676
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:15,240
We're going to be asking you to make one large strudel, 

677
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,000
either with a sweet filling or a savoury filling, 

678
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,240
but what Mary and Paul want to see is extremely gorgeous, delicate strudel pastry 

679
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,240
with a very professional finish. 

680
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,680
You've got three-and-a-half hours to go, so...on your marks, get set, bake! 

681
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,760
'A strudel is made by stretching a piece of pastry until it is wafer thin. 

682
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,640
'It's then filled with cooked vegetables or fruit, gently rolled and baked. 

683
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,880
'The filling should be moist and succulent, 

684
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,880
'while the pastry should be brittle with a flaky finish.' 

685
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,440
Until I began practising making this particular strudel, 

686
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,120
I had never made strudel pastry before. 

687
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,920
In lots of recipes, it says, "Use shop-bought," so that's what I do. 

688
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,600
'First, the bakers must make the pastry by mixing eggs, flour and water.' 

689
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:10,880
Apparently, they've been making strudels since the 2nd century BC or something. 

690
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,040
'Strudel pastry is so difficult to make that even top chefs buy it in ready-made sheets. 

691
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,960
The one pastry that I have to confess I would buy. 

692
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,040
Very tricky to do - elastic dough, that's the key. 

693
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,480
Are we being mean asking them to do a strudel challenge at this juncture in the bake off? 

694
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,680
Absolutely! 

695
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,040
Oooh! Of course! 

696
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:38,520
Yeah, I'm having to start again cos I cos I stupidly.... It's my own fault. 

697
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,720
I put my finger into the Magimix and slid it across the blade. 

698
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,240
It's knocked me off-balance a little minute but I'll be all right. 

699
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,560
It's tricky because it's getting the elasticity into the dough... 

700
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:57,520
erm, so that you can get this stretching, stretching, until it's almost tissue-paper thin. 

701
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,720
Brendan's making a spinach, cheese and walnut strudel. 

702
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,840
I noticed from your notes that you are going to roll up your sleeves 

703
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:11,680
- and oil your arms.
- Yes, the idea is to...
- I'm watching this!
- The idea is that you... 

704
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,360
Yes, you need to oil up to here because you're going under the pastry. 

705
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,360
Are you going to stretch it out with your forearm? 

706
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,320
Yeah, so that I really do get it really thin. 

707
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,640
I thought it would be nice to see the roses through the thinness of the pastry. 

708
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,920
- Yeah.
- You're raising the bar, Brendan. 

709
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,960
That's what it's all about - roll it carefully so it doesn't break 

710
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,720
and keeping it moist as you do it - you'll end up with a great strudel. 

711
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,240
'Kneading causes friction, which helps the gluten in flour become elastic. 

712
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,200
'If the bakers don't work the pastry enough, it will rip when they try to stretch it.' 

713
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,600
Apparently, you should be able to read the Bible through your pastry, it should be that thin. 

714
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,360
You should be able to put it on top of a page and still read through it. 

715
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,440
'Sarah-Jane is making a sweet strudel with sour cherries. 

716
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,240
'She's added beaten egg whites to ricotta cheese 

717
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,320
'and is hoping the filling will set and not seep through the sides.' 

718
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:06,400
Obviously this is your strudel dough, made with plain flour? 

719
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,560
- Plain flour - much easier to roll out.
- Hang on! 

720
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,120
Is that needed? Is that what you do? 

721
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,360
No, that's not what I've been doing. 

722
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,280
All you're trying to do on a strudel... 

723
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,720
is build up the resistance, build up the gluten in the dough itself by stretching it. 

724
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,800
It's the speed that stretches it quicker, you see? It's decent dough. 

725
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,720
So you're grabbing and twisting it? 

726
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,840
- Grab and twist and flick? 
- Yeah, try it. 

727
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,720
- Grab and twist and then... slap and toss.
- Right over here. 

728
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,280
THEY LAUGH 

729
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,080
- Oooh!
- That's quite fun. 

730
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,480
- He's doing the smashing thing. 
- Yeah, it's rubbish. 

731
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,440
It is utter rubbish. It's traditional, so you can't slag it, but it's rubbish. 

732
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,840
This would put in more power than I could ever put in, so... 

733
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,240
- Hold it by the end and flick it. 
- It's horrible. 

734
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,800
No, no, that looks really good - so far that you... 

735
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,800
- Oh!
- Well, I'm glad I wasn't standing there! 

736
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:09,680
- Oh, it's such a joke! 
- Whose dough is that? 

737
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:16,840
- Oh, Cathryn!
- Oh, it's so hairy! 
- I'm so sorry. 

738
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,600
Don't be silly, you didn't throw it on the floor. 

739
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,440
But I made you try and throw it on the floor. Don't throw it away. 

740
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,360
- Have you seen the carpet in it?
- Well, take the carpet out. 

741
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:32,120
- Wrap it in some oil.
- It's got green carpet in it. I'm not serving Mary Berry green carpet. 

742
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:41,160
- Cathryn, do you blame me? 
- Completely, but, you know, I'll get over it. 

743
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,320
Of course I don't! It's fine. 

744
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:57,720
The dough needs to rest for half an hour to give it a chance to strengthen before its final stretch. 

745
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,840
The bakers use this time to prepare their fillings. 

746
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,360
I'm just piercing these raisins here, 

747
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:10,640
so as that they are more likely... to absorb water, 

748
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,640
so this should stop myself having a soggy bottom. 

749
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:20,160
James is making a strawberry, rhubarb and ginger strudel. 

750
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,160
The hardest bit for me is the filling. 

751
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,400
Rhubarb and strawberries, what they've got in common - they ooze a lot of water. 

752
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,000
The last time I made it, my girlfriend said that it looked like a plate of sick, 

753
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,320
so it doesn't really bode well, does it? 

754
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,720
He's just removed his glove and the blood is all down his arm. 

755
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,120
- What's the matter?
- John's cut himself. 

756
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,680
His glove is full of blood. 

757
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,280
I need to wash it. Don't... Look, don't... 

758
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,800
- It's making me feel really dizzy. 
- That's fine. Just sit down. 

759
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,200
I'm going to have a quick look, all right? Don't look. 

760
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,200
'John's been soldiering on with a cut finger, 

761
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,760
'but it's deeper than first feared and stretching the pastry has stretched the wound.' 

762
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,440
It's not actually bleeding now, which is good. 

763
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,160
'Luckily, there's a doctor in the marquee. Danny is an intensive care consultant.' 

764
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,440
- Have you got a dressing?
- I've done everything. All I need to do now is make the dough. 

765
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,280
You can't do it with your finger like this. 

766
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,640
The last thing you need to worry about is a strudel. 

767
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,040
'John's wound is too deep for him to carry on baking. 

768
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:22,000
'He's leaving the marquee earlier than anyone expected.' 

769
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,840
'I'm just so gutted because I think my strudel's going to be amazing. 

770
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,200
'I've got to see a doctor now. It's a waste of time for everyone involved.' 

771
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,560
I just think, "What an...idiot!" 

772
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,320
It's annoying cos John would have probably made one of the best strudels here. 

773
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,800
'It's a real shame. He'll be absolutely gutted.' 

774
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,000
'Six bakers remain in the Showstopper Challenge.' 

775
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,760
Bakers, you've got one hour to go. 

776
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,320
'The bakers must now turn their ball of dough 

777
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,640
'into a wafer-thin sheet, measuring over two metres long.' 

778
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,400
It's got to be super, super thin and if you get a hole in the middle of it, 

779
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,520
at the start, before you've finished stretching, 

780
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,920
you can't stretch it any more, 

781
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:10,800
so we don't want any tears at all early on in the pastry-stretching. 

782
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:19,760
'Stretching a strudel needs a delicate hand but the bakers must also be brave enough 

783
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,560
'to pull their pastry, knowing that it could rip at any moment.' 

784
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,840
I like to do as much of it as I can with the rolling pin, 

785
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,520
just cos there's less opportunity for it to tear that way. 

786
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,160
You have to stretch it by hand. 

787
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,200
I think the rolling pin doesn't achieve the same result. 

788
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,720
He's rolled his sleeves up - he means business. 

789
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:49,120
You should, when I'm finished, be able to see the little roses through it. 

790
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,160
It's quite nice, nice feeling. 

791
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,720
At home, it's quite therapeutic, it's quite good fun. 

792
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,840
- I like doing it at home.
- Just not so much doing it here.
- No. 

793
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:08,160
Look, you can start to see the rose motif coming through. 

794
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,040
'Once the pastry's stretched to breaking point, it's time to add the filling.' 

795
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,280
That's looking very good. Are you worried about that mixture being too liquidy? 

796
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,800
Yes, that's the rationale behind the raisins. 

797
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:34,360
'The judges are expecting lots of layers so a tight roll is essential.' 

798
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,200
This is going to be interesting. 

799
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,920
I've never done this before. 

800
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:50,000
Oh, OK, I was worried for a second. I've calmed down now. That's actually really good. 

801
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,360
That's it. 

802
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,880
Ah, this is the lattice, OK. 

803
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,400
Oh, Brendan, you are a clever sausage. 

804
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,120
This is you basically dressing the strudel in a string vest! 

805
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:14,040
'The perfect strudel should be a dark brown colour.' 

806
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,840
One strudel in the oven. 

807
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,680
Right. 

808
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,000
Because the pastry is so thin, 

809
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,040
the difference between under-baked and burnt 

810
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,200
can be a matter of seconds. 

811
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,960
I'm going to cook it... 

812
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,440
for 40 minutes, 

813
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,640
but baste it every ten minutes with butter. 

814
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,160
So, I'm going to set that one for 40 

815
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,320
and then that one for ten. 

816
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:53,760
- GERMAN ACCENT:
- OK, bakers, funf minutes for strudels! 

817
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,600
My strudel's got a haemorrhage. Do I mean haemorrhage? 

818
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:02,280
- Haemorrhage or haemorrhoid?
- Oh, God, yes it's got a proboscis for sure. 

819
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,280
Oh, lor. 

820
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,680
When moisture in the filling heats up, 

821
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:11,080
it creates steam and puts pressure on the pastry and can cause leaks. 

822
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,880
I'm just worried about all the sauce running into the bottom 

823
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,080
of the strudel to keep it wet. 

824
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,000
It looks fine from the outside - I've had that before. 

825
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,200
Cut into it and a big lump of dough at the bottom so... 

826
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,960
It's split here, which I think is really because I've got 

827
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,560
the pastry so very thin that it's just gone from a point of weakness. 

828
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:35,880
It's sad. I'm going home after this. 

829
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,600
Maybe I'll turn it round so I can't see it. What you can't see... 

830
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,640
I thought the problem was going to be 

831
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,760
whether they liked the taste of it, not whether it was going to burst. 

832
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,280
- Strudel rupture. 
- Strudel rupture. Oh, woops. 

833
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,200
That reminds me of John's finger earlier on. 

834
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,080
Is that ready to come out? 

835
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,760
I think I will take it out just because it's split. 

836
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:03,000
Bakers you have got one minute to wrangle your strudels 

837
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,280
and bring them home to Mummy. 

838
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,200
I've had a little look around, 

839
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,080
Brendan's done a lattice work, bit of diamond shape on the top... 

840
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,600
Cathryn's got some problems at the moment with leakage. 

841
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,280
Oh, look! 

842
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,840
Smiling... 

843
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,360
James has got some leaking raspberries 

844
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,080
and strawberries pouring out of that. 

845
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,000
We want to make sure there are no soggy bottoms 

846
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,600
If it's leaked you will get wet. 

847
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,240
They've got to be really well done in the middle as well as 

848
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,000
- crisp pastry on the outside. 
- Absolutely. 

849
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,240
And that is six, five, 

850
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:49,000
four, three, two, one. 

851
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,520
That's it. 

852
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,840
For the six remaining bakers, it's judgment time. 

853
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,720
It's an apple, sour cherries, raisins and mixed nuts strudel. 

854
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,600
You've gone for the classical thing. The layers are a bit thick. 

855
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,240
The very centre here, is not quite cooked underneath. 

856
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,840
But the flavour of it, I really like. 

857
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,640
- I like the chunky pieces of fruit in there.
- Thanks very much, Ryan. 

858
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,000
Thank you. 

859
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,000
It is a roasted vegetable couscous and sheep's cheese. 

860
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,680
Good flake. 

861
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:45,320
Lovely and thin, the pastry, from the outside anyway. 

862
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,200
Gosh, that is full of interest, Cathryn. 

863
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,280
You have kept the cheese apart, 

864
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,080
you have all the different colours coming through there. 

865
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,000
Thank you. 

866
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,520
That's unusual. 

867
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,760
Good strudel, it's nice and then and the interior is delicious. 

868
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,480
It all goes really well together. 

869
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,200
Thanks. 

870
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,800
This is my sweet strudel. 

871
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,680
It is filled with a ricotta and dried cherry custard. 

872
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,960
There's not much colour on it? 

873
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,200
OK. 

874
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,160
- Can you see how pale it is there? 
- OK. 

875
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,960
- It looks more like a sweet pastry than it does a strudel.
- OK. 

876
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,960
- Did I not get it thin enough? 
- No, it is not thin enough. 

877
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,080
It has got a little bit of a gap between the top and the filling. 

878
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,600
The strudel itself is not crisp. 

879
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:43,000
The filling is lovely, but that is not strudel-like. 

880
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:43,920
OK. 

881
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:51,480
We have got a strawberry and rhubarb strudel with raisins on top. 

882
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,360
It's nice and thin. You've had a few leaks, have you? 

883
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,800
Just the one I think, one big one. 

884
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:01,520
It's a bit of a mess in there, isn't it, with all the fruit? 

885
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,560
It was a difficult filling to choose 

886
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,600
because the strawberries and rhubarb are pretty wet. 

887
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,840
I do like the taste, but I don't like the texture. 

888
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,240
It is like a mush that goes through it. 

889
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,200
It's a savoury strudel, it has got leek, potato, 

890
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,360
pistachio and Gruyere cheese inside. 

891
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,880
You can see the flakes. It is thin. 

892
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,280
I think it looks great, it has got a nice strong colour. 

893
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,240
You have actually filled the inside of it properly so that the strudel 

894
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,440
sits on the top and there are no gaps, which is good. 

895
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,920
The filling is absolutely solid and beautiful and very lovely 

896
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,280
- flavour to it.
- Thank you very much. 

897
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,040
Well done. 

898
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,520
The vegetables are spinach and courgette 

899
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,600
with three different herbs. 

900
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:53,040
There are three cheeses, two soft ones and then feta crumbled over it. 

901
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,800
I like this latticework on the topic. 

902
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,280
The only problem is that I hope inside there, 

903
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,200
the strudel is baked properly. 

904
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,680
The colour is quite pale 

905
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,600
so don't be afraid to leave it in the oven longer. 

906
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:09,760
The flavouring of the leeks and courgettes is very good. 

907
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,280
The layers look pretty good, they are nice and thin, 

908
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,640
but for me it needed that extra bit of colour. 

909
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:24,280
I think it will be very close between myself and Sarah-Jane. 

910
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,560
I did say before that whoever had the worst strudel was going to go 

911
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,760
and I think the person who had the worst strudel is Sarah-Jane. 

912
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,360
There was a lot of blood for a cut finger. 

913
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:37,040
He had a blood glove! It was grim. 

914
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:42,240
It was just really awful that John didn't get to make his. 

915
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,360
These rain clouds are sign of impending doom. 

916
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,960
It is a total rollercoaster, this Bake Off. 

917
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,560
I thought it would just be a nice, gentle plod. 

918
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,960
It is not, it is the craziest rollercoaster you've ever been on, 

919
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,720
in a marquee, in the middle of a field. It's mental! 

920
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,720
Oh, dear! 

921
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,440
Already a baker down, 

922
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,400
Mary and Paul will decide who's next to leave. 

923
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,240
I don't know about you, I feel slightly drained 

924
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,160
and hysterical after our strudel dramas. 

925
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,760
Paul and Mary, shall we start with the positives? Who came out on top? 

926
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,640
O-positive, which is what John's strudel was! 

927
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,240
Who's up for Star Baker? 

928
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,040
I think Brendan again. 

929
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:30,680
Today with the strudel, again he went the extra mile by putting the latticework on the top as well. 

930
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,880
The flavour of that I really enjoyed. 

931
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,560
But I think that someone who has really surprised us today is Danny. 

932
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:41,200
She has done such an unusual strudel. Lovely wafer-thin pastry... 

933
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,400
And in perfect melodramatic irony, 

934
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,480
the heavens have opened as I am about to discuss 

935
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,160
who is potentially in trouble. 

936
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,280
This has been a very exceptional week. 

937
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,200
- Who is there?
- Well, Sarah-Jane. 

938
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:58,040
It all sounded very good on paper, this custard and excellent flavoured fruits 

939
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:01,800
at the bottom, but her pastry was just a little bit too thick. 

940
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,560
I think James has not had a particularly good weekend. 

941
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,480
The inside of that was just too much of a mush. 

942
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:12,040
- It was a good flavour, but not enough texture.
- What about John? 

943
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:16,440
- Do you count John in this mix? 
- Well, I think, yes. 

944
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,880
You have to look at where he came on the first two 

945
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,680
and he wasn't particularly strong. 

946
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,240
I've looked at this and figured out 

947
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,280
this challenge and taken out this challenge 

948
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,840
and parked it, and looked at the other two and you'd still end up with the same three. 

949
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,280
So... 

950
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,040
John, James and Sarah-Jane. 

951
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,080
Yes. 

952
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,960
Well, it is a difficult week this, 

953
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,520
- and we wish you luck with your deliberations.
- It is tough.
- I know. 

954
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:55,120
Bakers, it has been a tough one this one. 

955
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:00,080
Who would ever have believed that strudel could be so dangerous? 

956
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,520
Let's start on a really positive note 

957
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:08,800
and focus on the person who Paul and Mary really feel has stood out 

958
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,240
and it is a person who has shown consistency, great flavours, 

959
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,400
cracking latticework, it is the one and only Brendan, Star Baker. 

960
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,640
Well done. 

961
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,080
APPLAUSE Well done, Brendan. 

962
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,240
Well done, Brendan. 

963
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,520
As you know, Mel and I rotate this week on week 

964
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,720
because it is really onerous and really hard, as the weeks go by 

965
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,120
it gets harder and harder as they get to know you a little bit more. 

966
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:35,600
And we are incredibly fond of you and we don't want to lose anybody. 

967
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,000
But, the journey has to end this week for somebody. 

968
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,320
And that person is... 

969
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,760
..nobody. No-one's going 

970
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:56,280
because it just wasn't fair! 

971
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,320
And we are going to get rid of two of you next week. 

972
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
THEY TALK OVER EACH OTHER 

973
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,240
I think John injuring himself, it created a new precedent and I think 

974
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:13,160
it was unfair of us if we were just to judge the ones that were left. 

975
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:17,040
It was a very difficult decision for us to make and I think it is 

976
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:21,440
the right one and next week, gosh, it will be two going! 

977
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,600
I will be watching them next week like I've never watched them before. 

978
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,200
Two people leaving? 

979
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,560
That is going to be really tough. 

980
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:34,720
I have another chance to bake again 

981
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,360
and to prove that I am here for a reason and not just lucky 

982
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,080
because John cut his finger off! 

983
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,920
Oh, my days! 

984
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,680
- Next time...
- What's wrong with them? 
- It is the toughest Bake Off ever. 

985
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:52,080
- I am psyching myself up. 
- Two bakers will have to go... 

986
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,040
I'm a little bit frightened. 

987
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,480
..if they cannot master sweet dough. 

988
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,360
- This looks disgusting. 
- With signature sweet buns... 

989
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,000
..a Hollywood-sized technical challenge... 

990
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,240
- Absolute whoppers. 
- Doughnut doom. 

991
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,000
..and show-stopping sweet loaves. 

992
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,360
A little bit over the top. 

993
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:14,160
Who will make it to the quarterfinals? 

994
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,240
- Oh!
- Ah!
- Yes! 

995
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,320
And which two bakers will have to leave... 

996
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,000
- This is the horrible part... 
- ..the Great British Bake Off? 

997
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,120
The people not coming with us are... 

998
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,000
