1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,920
Over the last nine weeks we have seen the world's biggest cake,

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,840
twisted plaits, collapsing caramels, naked beef Wellington's,

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,720
boiled salty babas, a gingerbread Coliseum, a wonky Big Ben,

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,000
and a Key lime pie that broke all the rules.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,440
All in the name of finding Britain's best amateur baker.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,360
And in there are three bakers who've gone the distance.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,360
Three bakers who are about to do battle,

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,040
and only one can be victorious.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,560
Welcome to the first all-male Great British Bake Off final.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,160
Nine weeks ago...

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,840
I don't know whether to bake them or to do a bain-marie.

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,840
..12 of Britain's best home bakers...

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,520
I'm doing a Union Jack hidden design cake.

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,000
..from all over the country...

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,760
- That's got that little step further.
- Thank you very much indeed.

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,240
- ..first arrived in the Bake Off tent. 
- Urgh. Plop-a-dops.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,880
Facing Paul and Mary's toughest challenges...

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,040
Oh, golden syrup, why do you have to leak for...?

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,360
Stop dripping.

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,040
..in a bid to stay.

21
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,440
Psyching myself up.

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,440
I'm not serving Mary Berry cream carpet.

23
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes! Yes! Sorry. Yes!

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,120
But just three...

25
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,680
Hello, are you in there?

26
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,480
..prove they have what it takes...

27
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,320
- I'm just prepping my cloots. 
- ..to be a finalist.

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,800
The male will have a coxcomb.

29
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,840
Now Brendan, John and James face two final days of baking.

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,840
It might be one step a little bit too far.

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,920
Preparing for a traditional British summer fete.

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,240
- Dip it, I'm dipping, mate. 
- Only one of them...

33
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,560
The rest won't be as messy.

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,400
..can be crowned the winner...

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,440
- We've never had a situation like this.

36
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,280
- ..of the Great British Bake Off. 
- There's nothing to it really.

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:14,000
The road to this year's final has not been easy.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,520
- James has triumphed by taking risks. 
- Never ever do this.

39
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,200
Constantly experimenting.

40
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,480
I like the lavender, and I think you have really conquered that.

41
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,000
- And treating baking as a science. 
- You're such a clever thing, you are.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,400
It is in my nature to look to reach the pinnacle of what can be done.

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,000
Brendan has impressed by being this year's most knowledgeable baker.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,840
It's a beautiful thing. Brendan, you've done it again.

45
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,600
- His finishing has always been precisely executed. 
- They look so beautiful.

46
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,440
And his recipes have always celebrated nostalgic home baking.

47
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,200
I think you've done a good job there,

48
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,400
but keep away from the '70s decoration.

49
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,840
I think my track record has to make me a very, very strong contender to win.

50
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,320
- John's huge passion for baking... 
- I feel like you're cutting through my heart.

51
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,000
..has been revealed in his bold and modern designs.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,880
I think it's a magnificent construction.

53
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,240
And recipes influenced by classic French patisserie.

54
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,920
- Cooking with flavour. Well done. That's proper. 
- I had a nightmare this week.

55
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,480
The Bake Off tent, it was absolutely pitch black, and there were

56
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,520
spotlights on Brendan and James's desk,

57
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,280
I was in the dark, shouting, "Can you put the lights on?"

58
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,080
So I've been really, really worried about the whole thing.

59
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,240
James, Brendan, John.

60
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,600
Welcome to this,

61
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,200
the Great British Bake Off all-male final.

62
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,160
And I have to say, the musk of testosterone

63
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,000
and icing sugar in the tent is very, very heady.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,320
Your first challenge, the Signature Challenge

65
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,040
will put you through your pastry paces one more time.

66
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,680
We've decided to set you the challenge of making a French

67
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,920
decorative pie classic, called...

68
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,600
- SHE LISPS 
- A Pithivier.
- A Pithivier?
- Yes, a Pithivier, it's a special recipe.

69
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,720
We'd like your choice of savoury fillings,

70
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,520
plus we'd like obviously the puff pastry top and bottom.

71
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,240
We are looking for really good flake, and impressive layers.

72
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,960
You got two and a half hours.

73
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,400
- On your marks... 
- Get set...
- Bake.

74
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,600
Named after the northern French town it's said to originate from,

75
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,040
Pithivier is a simple round pie, made of two discs

76
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,680
of golden rough puff pastry, with a dome of filling sealed inside.

77
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,000
Usually that is sweet.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,440
They are making a savoury one, quite a challenge.

79
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,440
When you're actually making the filling,

80
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,680
you must think about the blend of ingredients together

81
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,880
that's going to go with the rough puff pastry.

82
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,600
You've got to be careful with that, because it releases juices

83
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
which will then sit on the pastry underneath,

84
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,080
and cause a line of moisture.

85
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,080
And it is important to have, for me, the classic decoration of that

86
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,240
half circle going all the way round in a very regular pattern.

87
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,040
The nerves are going to play a huge part in this.

88
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,880
This is the last of their signature challenges.

89
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,200
The finalists have to perfect a rough puff pastry.

90
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,280
Today is going to be massive, because the Pithivier is such

91
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,640
a visible pastry presentation. It has to be good.

92
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,600
Where chunks of butter are added to flour to create crucial layers in the baked pastry.

93
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,760
I have been practising my puff quite a lot, so to speak!

94
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,960
I'd never made rough puff pastry before this week,

95
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,080
and I had to learn it specifically for the final.

96
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,640
It does worry me a little bit, that this is something

97
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,520
that I've not done before, and the other bakers have.

98
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,280
James is giving this French classic a Spanish twist,

99
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,320
filling his Pithivier with chorizo, chicken and red pepper.

100
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,120
When I met my girlfriend's grandparents for the first time I brought this pie.

101
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,600
I think I made an all right first impression!

102
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,480
James learnt to bake as a boy

103
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,840
with his grandmother at home, in Shetland.

104
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm not sure I can quite join the dots from applying to now.

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,160
Absolutely brilliant.

106
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,920
I thoroughly recommend for everyone to apply next year.

107
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,400
Now studying medicine at Glasgow University,

108
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,240
he lives with housemate, Julia, and girlfriend, Fenella.

109
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,480
- I think we made you apply, did we not?
- Yeah, you pressured me into it.

110
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,680
I don't think any of us ever

111
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,760
thought it was actually going to come to this.

112
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,280
We were just like, it will be a laugh.

113
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,400
Just fill it out, send it off and see what happens.

114
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,240
I think it's fantastic he's got this far.

115
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,720
Throughout the Bake Off, he's been studying for his end of year exams.

116
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,120
For his final bakes, he's hitting the books again.

117
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,640
I was astounded actually, at the amazing classical texts that

118
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,040
you can get pretty much any library to do with baking.

119
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,280
You kind of want to push the boat out, because it's the final,

120
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,280
and take a lot of risks, but at the same time you can't risk a disaster.

121
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,960
And hopefully knowledge is power!

122
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,840
Basically I've both rubbed in the butter and cubed the butter

123
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,080
and combined it with the wet mixture.

124
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,560
I think it just gives it a little bit more puffiness,

125
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,600
a bit more flakiness.

126
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,200
The finalists now have a huge time management issue.

127
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,720
What you're doing is trying to achieve layers of

128
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,160
butter between the dough.

129
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,680
They need to roll and fold their pastry dough.

130
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,320
I'm going to do Paul's technique of folding the pastry,

131
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,040
the book fold, which actually worked really well the last time I did it.

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,640
And use every minute while it rests in the fridge

133
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,040
between folds to perfect their filling.

134
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,560
I won't let myself get carried away, like last week,

135
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,040
and stressed out, because it just ends up making it taste rubbish.

136
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,360
John's Pithivier is a taste of Italy.

137
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,640
His book turned rough puff will cover

138
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,960
salsiccia Italian sausage, Taleggio cheese,

139
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,480
lardons, roasted vegetables and caramelised onions.

140
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,200
Your key flavours in this are fantastic.

141
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,600
How you getting on with your pastry at the moment?

142
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,560
Obviously, I've done rough puff before,

143
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,200
but it has been hit and miss here,

144
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,680
but I'm going to try your method of putting it in lower,

145
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,000
and getting the butter to melt, so it rises.

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,600
I'm going to give that a try today.

147
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,360
- I just hope your rough puff rises to the occasion.
- Thank you. Me too!

148
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Leave a pause round that pun, it needs to be savoured.

149
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,920
When I applied, never thought I would get onto it,

150
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,400
never mind the in the final.

151
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,200
I just said I want to get through week one.

152
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,640
Law student, John, shares a flat in Manchester with his best friend Hollie.

153
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,920
Sometimes I wake up, get up for work,

154
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,200
by nine o'clock he's all ready made, like, lemon curd.

155
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,560
He's made a brioche.

156
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,040
Since I finished uni last weekend

157
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,640
I been practising every day for the final, because I really, really want to win it.

158
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,360
I want to be a baker when I grow up.

159
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,200
But John's family have always seen him

160
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,000
having a glittering legal career in the city.

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,960
We were all a size ten before he started on

162
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,360
The Great British Bake Off!

163
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,720
- That's not true!
- I don't think you were born a size ten, mum!

164
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,000
When he first started, I thought he might be out on week one,

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,560
I didn't get too panicked, thinking,

166
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,480
"Oh, well he might not be in it for very long,

167
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,040
"and then he can do his revision and things like that."

168
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,400
As the weeks went on, I was thinking, "Oh, my goodness.

169
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,840
"He's doing quite well."

170
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,040
I think he's got a 33.33 percent chance of winning!

171
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,920
Then we can be really proud of him for the first time ever.

172
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,080
- That's nice. 
- He's never won anything before. No.

173
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,440
Three-legged race at school, perhaps!

174
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,920
I'll miss being here in the Bake Off tent to be honest, next week.

175
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,240
At home, people just eat it, and they don't really say,

176
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,840
"You need to work on your lamination," they eat it, and then go.

177
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,680
Whereas here, you get the appreciation

178
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
that you look for as a baker, because we all do.

179
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,200
People think that bakers are these dainty little housewives, but they're not,

180
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,080
they are quite controlling people who want

181
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,280
to be told they're loved, so, that's why I'm in it!

182
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,320
OK, bakers, that's half-time. Half way through.

183
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,880
Mel, strip off, get the orange segments out.

184
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,920
Oh, she's already naked!

185
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:42,000
With filling still cooking, the rested dough must be folded again.

186
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,240
The butter should form a faint marbled pattern

187
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,720
on the dough's surface.

188
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,040
Shouldn't see any butter by this point, but you can.

189
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,080
Now, if it doesn't work, that's you.

190
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,800
The dough must then be rested again, allowing James, Brendan,

191
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,560
and John, to return to their fillings.

192
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,800
I've roasted all my veg off,

193
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,040
and then I just tried to dry it off a little bit

194
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,400
on some kitchen roll, to try and prevent a soggy bottom.

195
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,000
I don't want it to be reduced too far, it will just go a bit dry.

196
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,040
Need it to retain some moisture in the filling.

197
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,320
There is a danger of the moisture in the spinach making

198
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,600
the bottom soggy, but I've drained it very, very well.

199
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,920
I've also bound it together with some goats' cheese and egg.

200
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,240
Brendan is the only baker making a vegetarian Pithivier,

201
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,840
with new potatoes, red pepper and caramelised garlic.

202
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,520
- Good Lord!
- Is there enough garlic there?
- Clove upon clove.

203
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,040
There will be a hundred metre radius around me...

204
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,600
But actually, by the time it's blanched and reduced

205
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,640
in its syrup, and so forth, you have a much sweeter result.

206
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,480
It won't leave you reeking of garlic for days afterwards.

207
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,640
Have you had a good practise at this? You sound so confident about it.

208
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,440
The neighbours have been delighted

209
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,080
that they were getting something savoury for once,

210
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,120
as opposed to something sweet.

211
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,640
Brendan's calm and steady progress to the final owes a great

212
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,360
deal to his Buddhist faith,

213
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,720
and the constant support of his friends and partner, Jason.

214
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,920
When I get overanxious, he's able to keep me grounded.

215
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,240
And I might not even be at the final stage

216
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,360
if he hadn't been there in the background.

217
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,400
My role is general kitchen porter and washer-upper.

218
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,720
Particularly become expert at cleaning out piping bags,

219
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,560
I would say that is my speciality.

220
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,480
For many people, baking is often a way that they connect

221
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,400
with their childhoods, and with happy memories,

222
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,560
and with recipes from mothers and grandmothers and aunties, and so on.

223
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,440
For Brendan, it's really quite the opposite, because he didn't

224
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,520
have that kind of background growing up in rural Ireland.

225
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,120
So, for him, baking, and doing well at baking is really

226
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,040
a sign of how much he's managed to overcome in his life.

227
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,440
As well as having the knowledge, I believe the one who can

228
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,520
keep their emotions in check is the one who's going to win.

229
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,800
Something else for washing up.

230
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,200
Am I expected to do that?

231
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,560
It feels good this morning, and it's going to plan.

232
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,840
So I'm actually enjoying it. And you just feel, "Is that arrogance?

233
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,840
"Will I be struck down for it in the afternoon or something?"

234
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,640
I come from a background of high-quality guilt,

235
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,160
so of course I feel guilty!

236
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,440
Bakers, finalists, men,

237
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,120
you have got one hour left on your Signature Final Challenge.

238
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,680
While the consistency of their fillings is crucial...

239
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,520
I've just chucked the filling in the warming drawer,

240
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,240
because of it's too cold, then it will take ages to cook.

241
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,320
..the bakers still need to leave enough time

242
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,400
to construct and bake their Pithivier.

243
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,720
There is enough time, basically, it's just getting them all together.

244
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,640
The various elements. But they need to be cool when they go in.

245
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,600
HE HUMS

246
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,240
To form the Pithivier, the pastry's cut into two discs

247
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,800
and the filling placed in a neat mound in the centre of the base.

248
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,200
I think I've got a bit too much!

249
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,040
The upper layer, which will form the classic dome, is cut larger

250
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,960
to cover the filling and give room to seal the edges.

251
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,520
If not completely sealed the pie could leak,

252
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,280
and ruin its appearance.

253
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,600
I know Brendan and John are both scalping the edges,

254
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,880
which is the traditional way, but this is a much easier way.

255
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,560
I'm creating a sunbeam, sunray pattern.

256
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,120
My presentation is stronger than James's, it's an area

257
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,920
I'm sure he will strengthen, like everything else he does.

258
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,280
I'm worrying that if I score the top, I'll just go right through it.

259
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,200
The Pithivier's time in the oven requires careful judgement.

260
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,760
The surface must be flaky and golden.

261
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,840
It's catching around the edge,

262
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,440
so I'm just going to have to wrap some foil around the edges

263
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,800
of the Pithivier, just because I don't want the edges of it to burn.

264
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,480
- That's looking good. 
- That's looking very good. It's like a big sun, isn't it?

265
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,240
The concealed filling cooked through, and the hidden pastry base crisp.

266
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,400
I'm thinking that it looks all right.

267
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,320
Probably should have waited another minute to take it out.

268
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,000
OK.

269
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,480
OK, bakers, that's it. That's time. I mean it.

270
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,280
I'm not taking the PITHIVIER! It's over.

271
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,080
It's judgment time in the final Signature Bake.

272
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,440
The appearance is most attractive.

273
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,680
You are meticulous to get that all the way round,

274
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,040
and it certainly looks absolutely lovely.

275
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,200
Just a little bit caught on the side, a difficult thing to do,

276
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,480
because it was almost to the edge of the oven.

277
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,520
- Great base.
- How about that? 
- I'm delighted with that, thank you.

278
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,960
That is a great base.

279
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,920
That's lovely, Brendan.

280
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,800
The spices aren't too much in it, and the garlic,

281
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,600
funnily enough, I mean I can taste it, but it's not overwhelming, which is nice actually.

282
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,040
And you didn't make the mixture too runny,

283
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,880
- because that would have made the pastry soggy.
- Excellent.

284
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,720
Thank you, that's great. Thank you very much.

285
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,720
I think it looks great. I love the detail.

286
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,840
Again, you've got this rich, dark brown colour around it,

287
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,320
which is key.

288
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,840
- I hope that the underneath is done. 
- Me, too.

289
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,680
- Oh, yeah!
- Hello! 
- It's good. It's crispy.

290
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,360
John, the flavour of that is very, very good indeed.

291
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,520
Such a lovely flavour. Taleggio cheese, your lovely sausage.

292
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,920
The pastry's very buttery, which is lovely. And it has got a good flake.

293
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,520
- The look of it, I think, is excellent.
- Stunning.

294
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,000
I think it looks quite attractive. A nice colour to it.

295
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,760
You could have gone bit further with it.

296
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,240
It's got a very good flake on the side, that looks very good.

297
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,880
I'm just wondering, when we cut into it, whether it's going

298
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,840
to be a little under done,

299
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,720
a little bit underneath, I don't know.

300
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,160
- Oh, no.
- You've got a bit of a soggy bottom there.

301
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,200
It's only where the moisture's sat on it.

302
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,560
- It's a little bit underdone there, too.
- Yeah.

303
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,640
It's a seasoned well. It's cooked really well.

304
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,640
There's a huge temptation, particularly with using

305
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,160
breast of chicken, when you have fried it, you didn't over fry it,

306
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,680
you just lightly browned it, and the chicken is perfect in there.

307
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,120
And the chorizo gives it real flavour.

308
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,240
But you only have to go through the first layer,

309
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,360
that's gone a bit soggy there again.

310
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,720
- Yeah. That's annoying. 
- That is annoying.

311
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,840
- It's just prevented the flake.
- Yeah.

312
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,680
It's a shame about that pastry.

313
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Wow. Actually that was a real surprise. That was disappointing.

314
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,400
I think we could say that was a ten out of ten really

315
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,440
because I can't subtract anything.

316
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,160
So there's a ten out of ten.

317
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,400
Now there's this afternoon, and then there's tomorrow.

318
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,720
So, I'm on a very good footing.

319
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,680
I'm really pleased with myself, definitely.

320
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,960
And it's given me the confidence now to go into the next round fighting.

321
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,040
Because I want to win this. I really want to win it.

322
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,920
It's time for that favourite challenge of yours,

323
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,520
the revered Technical Challenge.

324
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
Now, you should know how this works by now.

325
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,040
You've done it for nine weeks, it is judged blind,

326
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,760
so Paul and Mary, off you trot.

327
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,240
Literally a trot, please, Mary. Rising trot. Good girl.

328
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,120
She can still do it! Won several gymkhanas. Good girl.

329
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,840
Lovely filly!

330
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,800
Didn't expect that.

331
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:49,920
What we're asking you to do is to make and ice 25 fondant fancies.

332
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,320
Proper artisan, beautifully done, fondant fancies.

333
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,000
You need a square of delicate light sponge, a dome of buttercream...

334
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,120
- Stop it. 
- ..all encased in a glossy fondant.

335
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,440
All the very best. This is your last technical challenge. On your marks...

336
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
- Get set...
- Bake.

337
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,080
For today's technical challenge,

338
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,920
Paul and Mary's recipe contains even fewer instructions than usual.

339
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,120
I haven't made them before, but at least you're working with

340
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,440
sponges, and accuracy and so on, which, you know,

341
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,680
I do have some skills.

342
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,520
How long have we got for this?

343
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,560
I'm trying to remember what a fondant fancy actually looks like.

344
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,160
A very tricky technical challenge.

345
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,280
They've got to bake their cake absolutely level and evenly.

346
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,360
They've then got to divide it into 25.

347
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,280
Buttercream all the way round each square.

348
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,080
We were really rather kind, you know.

349
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,000
We could have asked them to split each one,

350
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,920
and put buttercream in the middle, but we didn't.

351
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,280
Kind, Mary! Kind!

352
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,760
We're giving them 25 perfect squares of sponge to do,

353
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,600
top them with marzipan,

354
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,800
put apricot jam on it, put buttercream round the outside,

355
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,720
put fondants on the top, and spin it with chocolate.

356
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,720
All in two and a half hours. That is difficult to do.

357
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,560
Following the recipe to the letter.

358
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,600
I'm doing it the old traditional way Mum would teach me back in 1997.

359
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,160
It's a fairly simple Victoria sponge we're making,

360
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,680
or lemon and Victoria sponge.

361
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,600
Sometimes I've been given stuff to do,

362
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,640
and it's embarrassing what it ends up with,

363
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,160
but at least this is familiar territory.

364
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,800
You can trip up at any stage but you've got to try and be focused,

365
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,200
which isn't always easy

366
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,680
when you're in the final of a baking competition.

367
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,760
It seems like a slightly thick dough. Oh, well.

368
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,440
I'll put the final egg in it.

369
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,280
Could've been disastrous.

370
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,240
A little bit of uncombined flour there. Can't have that.

371
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,760
Cover me, I'm going in.

372
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,880
25, 30 minutes, I'd say, for a cake of that size.

373
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,560
Right.

374
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,120
Now for the buttercream.

375
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,920
I'm breaking these up with my hands to break it down. It's a bit firm.

376
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,560
I'm just softening the butter on the lowest microwave temperature,

377
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,640
just so that it's easier to blend in with the icing sugar.

378
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,480
One use is to coat the sides and one is to pipe a rosette on top.

379
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,880
We need to keep this buttercream nice and smooth

380
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,560
because we need to ice tiny squares.

381
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,800
If it's hard, it'll drag them and break them.

382
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,640
Nothing to it, really.

383
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,000
(One miss.)

384
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,080
It's still sinking a little bit,

385
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,960
so I'm going to leave it for another minute or two.

386
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,240
Though...

387
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,680
Yeah. Just another minute.

388
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,440
Right, we're ready.

389
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,760
Right, so I'll leave that to cool and cool quickly.

390
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,400
90 minutes to go.

391
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,440
I would not normally set my jam. This is a special occasion.

392
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,920
Apricot jam is used to stick a thin layer of marzipan

393
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,640
to the surface of the cooled sponge.

394
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,760
That'll do.

395
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,520
Which must then be divided into 25 identical cakes.

396
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,640
And for that...

397
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,280
..I'm going to need a ruler.

398
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,520
Mary and Paul's recipe doesn't specify the size of the cakes required.

399
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,280
I'm going to have to sit and do the maths

400
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,360
cos I'm totally, totally gone blank in my head.

401
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,160
Just the quantity.

402
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,160
They're meant to be cubes I think, aren't they?

403
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,960
That's three centimetres up.

404
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,840
If that's the case, there will be quite a lot of off-cut.

405
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,720
There will be, like, this much off-cut

406
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,280
and then I might get slated for them being too small.

407
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,840
I can't really make my mind up with this.

408
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,280
Yeah, I'm going to just do it.

409
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,400
If the worst comes to the worst, it's just not big enough, is it?

410
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,200
It's working out well at the moment.

411
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,200
5, 10, 15, 20, 25.

412
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,840
They're very small, perhaps a little bit too small.

413
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,000
Mr Kipling would turn in his grave!

414
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,520
The sides of each cake must be covered with a smooth layer of buttercream.

415
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,400
I'm happy with them. Whether they're good or not is yet to be determined.

416
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,200
I think the judges will be looking for accuracy

417
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,320
and attention to detail.

418
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,400
These sorts of fancies require that, otherwise, why bother?

419
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,240
The recipe states that the fondant should be flavoured with rose-water...

420
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,920
..and coloured.

421
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,520
My recollection of fondant is that it's a delicate pink

422
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,840
rather than a deep one.

423
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,040
So we're going to have a deep one.

424
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,400
Finalists, you've got 30 minutes left on these fondant fancies.

425
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
My intention is to pour it over it.

426
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,240
I think it would be a mistake to dip it in fully, bodily.

427
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,840
I'm dipping, I'm dipping, mate.

428
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,880
I'm dipping.

429
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,320
Oh, I've lost it!

430
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,640
I might just drop it in, you know. Hand is always the best method.

431
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,720
To be honest, it's just quicker.

432
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,920
BRENDAN GROWLS

433
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,800
The rest won't be as messy, I promise you.

434
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,560
It does actually...

435
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,160
It feels remarkably...fun.

436
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,520
Right. Let me rethink this.

437
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,680
Maybe I should just dip it.

438
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,520
Dipping is the good idea.

439
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,880
Ah!

440
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,680
(Help.)

441
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,960
I'm going to have to use my fingers for this, you know.

442
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,160
Well, it's messy.

443
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,840
Maybe there is a simpler way but I don't know of it.

444
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,600
I haven't done this before.

445
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,880
- How hard can a fondant fancy be? 
- Yeah.

446
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,680
- Turns out, harder than and eight-plaited stranded loaf.
- Is it?

447
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,560
- Eight-strand plaited loaf, yeah. 
- Harder than baba?
- Harder.

448
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,680
There's more generation game, this, the bijou French patisserie.

449
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,240
Bijou was not what comes to mind.

450
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,880
Does this cut you to the quick,

451
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,200
that this is getting a bit messy and slapdash now?

452
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,080
- It's not my style. 
- I was going to say.

453
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,560
Bakers, you've got ten minutes of fondant fancy fondlage.

454
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,480
Ten minutes to go.

455
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,720
To decorate, melted chocolate should be piped in clean lines on top

456
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,120
and down the sides of the fondant.

457
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,240
Would you say that this is the definition of stress now?

458
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,600
Now, yes. I was fine up until we got to the dipping point.

459
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,520
Slow and steady wins the race.

460
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,640
Not bad, eh?

461
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,480
To complete the challenge,

462
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,240
25 fondant fancies must be arranged on a three-tiered cake stand.

463
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,040
That's two minutes, bakers. Two minutes.

464
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,560
What's the point?

465
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,840
They are semi-set.

466
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,600
What a mess.

467
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,280
What's done is done and cannot be undone.

468
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,360
That looks very tight but for some reason I felt totally relaxed.

469
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,240
It's not my finest work, is it?

470
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,040
Should we start from this side, Mary?

471
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,640
There's obviously issues with the fondant here.

472
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,480
Buttercream, I can see a little bit on some of them.

473
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,440
The chocolate looks, frankly, a bit of a mess.

474
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,840
That looks a very even bake.

475
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,480
Nice, thin layer of marzipan on the top.

476
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,320
It tastes quite nice.

477
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,600
The application of the buttercream is poor,

478
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,480
and if you don't have lovely smooth cut buttercream

479
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:55,480
round the outside, you cannot get the fondant to look sharp on the corners.

480
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,360
Then we come to these.

481
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,320
I don't quite know why they're so small,

482
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,000
because in a 20 centimetre tin,

483
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,280
if you cut squares, they're bigger than that.

484
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:09,240
The fondant is too wet, although they are fairly equal in size.

485
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,000
The chocolate on the top's a bit neater.

486
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,800
It's a lot of buttercream on the top of that one, isn't it?

487
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,400
They're so small, the buttercream's overwhelmed it.

488
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,080
Texture's all right though.

489
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,480
Right. This one. Actually, the colour's not bad.

490
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,920
The chocolate's OK.

491
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,800
The fondant looks a little bit thicker, doesn't it?

492
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,400
- Yeah.
- Nice sponge.

493
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,320
It's quite pungent, isn't it?

494
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,640
The rose-water is a little too strong.

495
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,880
The fondant does look marginally better than the other ones,

496
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,080
but again, it is too thin.

497
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,240
But can Paul and Mary pick a winner of the final Technical Challenge?

498
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,320
That was quite tricky, because they've all got their faults.

499
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,040
But the person in last place is...

500
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,560
..these two.

501
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,520
This one looks terrible. Whose is this one?

502
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,840
It was a time issue and part of it was the fondant.

503
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,120
It's just felt messy and it's not how I work.

504
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,120
What happened to the rest of the sponge?

505
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,280
I got a bit trigger happy with the knife, I think.

506
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,240
So, first is James, who had a very good rise in the sponge.

507
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,920
You had difficulty like everybody else with your fondant,

508
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,520
but it's a little more even than the rest.

509
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:46,120
But I wouldn't say that this was a very high standard at all for all of you.

510
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,000
Consider yourself chastised.

511
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,640
But actually, what it does is make tomorrow all the more important.

512
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,440
I am gutted, because obviously,

513
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,880
that's the final technical challenge.

514
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,760
And well, I messed it up.

515
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,720
I got a very, very good bake in the morning.

516
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,160
Pants in the afternoon.

517
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,440
I really want to do well tomorrow. Tomorrow is the day

518
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,280
that I really want to show a perfect set of cakes.

519
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,560
There's just one final challenge in this year's Bake Off.

520
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,920
It seems to me that the playing field is uncannily level.

521
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,480
It's very odd, because actually, John and Brendan had stepped away slightly from James.

522
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,080
His pastry wasn't as good as I thought it would be.

523
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,360
- And yet, when we come to the technical challenge... 
- Reverse.

524
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,960
Brendan, he let us down.

525
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,160
And John, I just couldn't really get the hang of why he'd cut them down so small.

526
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,880
James's strengths are his flavours and his technical ability.

527
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,080
So what you've got is a recipe for a showstopper

528
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,320
that has never happened before, that it goes down to the last challenge.

529
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,240
- This is so tense. I don't think we've ever had a situation like this. 
- No, we have not.

530
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,000
The great thing is, that we can also ask James to prescribe beta-blockers for us!

531
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,960
- So that's good.
- Can we?
- Yes! 
- Because he's a doctor.
- Exactly.

532
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,160
Morning, bakers. Of course, it's the Showstopper Challenge.

533
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,080
And we're going to get fiendish with you.

534
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,080
So today, we'd like you to create the perfect chiffon cake.

535
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,920
And we'd like you, for your inspiration for this final Showstopper cake,

536
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,800
to pick your personal highlight of 2012.

537
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,360
For example, if I was making my own inspirational cake,

538
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,160
I'd put a large 30 on it.

539
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,080
Because I reached that landmark this year.

540
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,640
So, you've got four hours on the clock.

541
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,640
It's the final, and whatever you create

542
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,680
is going to be served at our village fete.

543
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,160
Complete with limp bunting and torrential rain.

544
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,920
So, on your marks...

545
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,360
- Get set...
- Bake!

546
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,480
Chiffon is baking's most notoriously fickle sponge.

547
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,480
It's cloud-like texture stems from its oil and egg white based batter.

548
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,920
John, James and Brendan are free to create any fillings

549
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,880
or any decorative touches they wish.

550
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,760
But the chiffon's delicate structure can be easily overpowered by flavour.

551
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,160
It's also vulnerable to sinking

552
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,520
and often too light to support a tiered cake design.

553
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,920
My concept for 2012 is family reunion.

554
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,960
So I want this cake to capture the importance of healing family rifts,

555
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,040
maybe, or family reunion, the importance of sustaining that.

556
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,320
Brendan's Showstopper is an almond-coated raspberry chiffon,

557
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,960
topped with another heart-shaped chiffon and decorated with fresh raspberries.

558
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,160
About a year ago,

559
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,280
I made a determination to bring two streams of the family together.

560
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,720
And that's going to happen in the next weeks.

561
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,440
And so I'm calling the cake a family reunion cake.

562
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,800
- These people haven't met up for well over three decades.
- Wow.

563
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,480
And I just want to bring them together.

564
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,800
It seems a shame to keep rifts alive and so forth.

565
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,520
- So bringing them together... 
- Bridging the gap with cake.

566
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,720
- You've practised this?
- Yes. 
- And was it successful?

567
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,520
No, the first chiffon cake I made, it just phleugh, they collapsed,

568
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,720
they looked like a horrible pancake like things and I had to bin them!

569
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,480
The volatile chiffon sponge mix uses only the air

570
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,640
trapped in whipped egg whites to help it rise.

571
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,800
It's about batter, it's about beating,

572
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,200
it's about judgement, really.

573
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,760
And to ensure its light texture, it contains no butter.

574
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,560
That's just the oil, so that's the fat, instead of butter.

575
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,120
Just got to try to get it folded in nicely.

576
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,800
But the light texture of John's Showstopper could be disappearing.

577
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
This cake's not gone wrong for me before.

578
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,800
It's been a nice, tender cake with a great crumb, great flavour.

579
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,320
It's quite a dense cake because of the chocolate in there.

580
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,560
John's biblical bake consists of a dark chocolate

581
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,000
and orange chiffon cake, hell.

582
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,360
And a heaven made of lemon and coconut meringue cakelets.

583
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,280
- I feel like my 2012 has been up and it's been down.
- OK.

584
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,840
I've had, you know, time at uni and stuff, doing my exams,

585
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,000
it's been really tough.

586
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,440
- Then my nephews have all been born, so that's heaven.
- Aw!

587
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,000
There's been more heaven than hell,

588
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,960
but funnily, it's going to be a bigger hell cake than a heaven cake!

589
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,560
The whole structure sounds amazing. How high are we looking at here?

590
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,680
About this high. So it's not giant, but the bottom cake is so big

591
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,160
that it looks like a centrepiece.

592
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,280
- But John's Showstopper won't be the biggest.
- I'm making five cakes.

593
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,960
I was going to incorporate fruit into the cakes.

594
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,320
It's something I've never done before. I thought it would be a nice thing to do.

595
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,880
But actually, I don't think it's worth it. I'll just get it,

596
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,640
instead of having fruit in the cake mixture, I'll just, you know,

597
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,080
have loads of fruit in and on the cake.

598
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,720
James is making five chiffon cakes

599
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,760
covered in mascarpone and honey icing.

600
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,720
Four will be individually flavoured with Turkish delight,

601
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,200
pistachios, blueberries and raspberries.

602
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,360
The fifth aims to bring them together in happy union.

603
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,120
2012 is a big year for the United Kingdom

604
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:00,000
and so I decided to do a cake that emphasises the "United".

605
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,280
- The idea of my cake is the whole is better than some of the parts. 
- Aw!

606
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,760
And so we have a central Union Jack cake

607
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,720
with components from each of the four surrounding cakes.

608
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,160
Each one is going to have a specific flavour as well,

609
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,720
pistachio, blueberry, raspberry?

610
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,360
- And rose, English rose.
- Oh! 
- English rose? Yeah, very clever.

611
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,800
- You're happy with the timings? 
- I'm pretty short on time,

612
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,760
but I can fit three cakes in the oven at a time.

613
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,120
Have a good time, James. I'll see you later.

614
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,080
Three hours remaining...

615
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,240
This is the critical part of it, getting the sponge right.

616
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,680
I'll relax a wee bit more when that comes out of the oven.

617
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,600
Even though they've finished their sponge mix,

618
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:42,360
every move the bakers now make can still radically alter their chiffon's texture.

619
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,720
Because you don't want to deflate the egg whites,

620
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,840
so get it as close to the tin floor as possible.

621
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,320
The complicated bit is dividing it up into three equal cakes' worth.

622
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,680
The final of the Great British Bake Off, is it time for exact measurements?!

623
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,800
It's good enough.

624
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,880
You do that to get rid of any air pockets.

625
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,360
If there are any air pockets,

626
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,920
it will develop large holes like you have in bread.

627
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,760
I'll just bang it on the counter top,

628
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,360
just to expel any larger air bubbles.

629
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,560
There is a risk, doing a massive cake, an 11 inch cake,

630
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,480
especially a chiffon cake, it's huge.

631
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,560
Because it's sort of unsupported in the middle,

632
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,320
especially a perfectly round one.

633
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,160
John is also making smaller, plainer chiffons.

634
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,120
Could you ask if there are any Q-tips?

635
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,960
Which will form heavenly clouds on the top of his cake.

636
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,520
Brendan's reunion cake will have a heart-shaped second tier.

637
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,240
But James's nation cakes are already proving tricky to unite.

638
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,040
This is the mixture for the rose and pistachio.

639
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,400
He can only bake three at a time.

640
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,680
Oh!

641
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,520
- CRASHING 
- Oh!

642
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,080
That's my cake!

643
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,360
I'm just thinking about what to do. How much time have we got?

644
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,840
What happened, James?

645
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,960
Och, it was silly, it was sitting on the stool and I knocked it and threw it all over the floor.

646
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,160
- I threw it away.
- You can make a new one, eh?
- I think I can. 
- Of course you can.

647
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,960
- Erm, how do we make a new cake? 
- So, you've got...

648
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,160
- I need eggs.
- Let's get you eggs.

649
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,680
He'll pull it back, I know he will. I've got every belief in him.

650
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,920
It's the one thing you dread happening.

651
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,640
I will try, and I will try, and I will try again.

652
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,040
Everything John, James and Brendan have baked will be served

653
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,280
to family and friends at the Bake Off's very own summer fete...

654
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,520
It's been strange because, honestly, I wasn't looking forward to coming back because, you know,

655
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,160
I was very, very disappointed when I left the Bake Off.

656
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,280
But coming back, actually, I'm thinking of the fond memories

657
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,880
and it's been a really happy experience, coming back.

658
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,920
..where this year's winner will be crowned.

659
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,760
When I think of what I've seen all of them bake,

660
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,840
I don't see how you could put a Pithivier between them.

661
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,560
I think from the very beginning,

662
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,800
Brendan was the person who stood out the most.

663
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,040
I would love it if John won, because he's really worked so, so, so hard.

664
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,200
James has done really well, and so has Brendan.

665
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,360
He's done super well as well. So, yeah, any out of them two!

666
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,160
I would say probably Brendan would edge it.

667
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,200
Today, I've got a feeling in my tummy that James is going to be the winner.

668
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,080
Second time. It's in the oven!

669
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,400
Yeah, I'm going to let it cool now upside down for five or ten minutes.

670
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,160
That just allows the sponge to keep its form

671
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,800
and it doesn't sort of concertina in on itself.

672
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,720
If you were to turn them upright now, they would start to collapse.

673
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,320
- While their sponges cool... 
- Ten minutes.

674
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,800
..the bakers turn their thoughts to fillings and toppings.

675
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,400
The glaze is made by boiling sugar and water to make a syrup

676
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,880
and then you add cocoa powder and gelatine to that.

677
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,200
It's like a ganache, but it's very, very shiny. Very beautiful.

678
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,840
Not as bitter as a chocolate ganache.

679
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,800
This is raspberry jelly jam, if you like.

680
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,080
I'm looking for soft set jam, rather than firm set.

681
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,480
It's going to be used to flavour the buttercream

682
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,200
and it will also be used to glaze the raspberries on top.

683
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,680
James is hoping to decorate his English cake with home-made Turkish delight.

684
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,080
- I don't really know what I'm looking for. 
- Rosewater, gelatine, sugar,

685
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,920
and cornflour are gently simmered with water

686
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,880
until the mixture only just starts to thicken.

687
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,360
I can just hope that this is right.

688
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,680
James needs to allow enough time for it to cool...

689
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,000
No! It's gone down the sides.

690
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,400
..to achieve its elusive soft-set jelly texture.

691
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,800
Because Turkish delight is pink, I thought it would be nice to have a pink St George's Cross.

692
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,880
- This is the moment of truth with this cake. 
- HE WHISTLES

693
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,240
GENTLE TAPPING

694
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,760
It shy because it's been watched so closely.

695
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,400
The bake is good.

696
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,640
JAMES LAUGHS

697
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,120
All the chiffons are out of their tins. The decorating can begin.

698
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,480
It's made of butter, cream cheese and raspberry jam.

699
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,920
And I've given it extra whipping to take it more like a mousse

700
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,240
so it will be light and airy.

701
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,560
I have done the top of one cake, the sides of none.

702
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,520
Presumably this is

703
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,000
because you want a cake that looks like it's stepped out of a salon!

704
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,480
I need to re-melt it to get it nice and smooth.

705
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,360
That's the best I can do with that.

706
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,440
It's not as smooth as I would have liked.

707
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,120
Lovely, I will come by later for a cut and colour.

708
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,680
Free of charge for you!

709
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,360
In 45 minutes, the finalists must face the judges.

710
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,920
You've got three distinctive characters here.

711
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,920
Brendan is traditional, it looks quite a normal -

712
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,840
if you can call a chiffon cake a normal - cake.

713
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:27,360
It will be tricky enough. But the flavours he's got are interesting.

714
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,480
He's using the almond extract.

715
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,280
I think John is technically so good.

716
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,000
I reckon he's made that four times over the week last week

717
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,440
and he's doing all sorts of new techniques.

718
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,160
James, the great innovator.

719
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,520
- He is using the idea of the flag in the middle.
- He's pushing himself.

720
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:51,400
He's always shown us he can pull it together at the end. I reckon he might be short of time.

721
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,520
This, we know, is the standout piece that could win the Bake Off.

722
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,880
No pressure.

723
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,840
Turkish delight is a bit more like that putty

724
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,160
you put in your shower to stop it leaking.

725
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,760
- No!
- Have you done this before?
- No.

726
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,200
- You haven't done it before and it's a final.
- He's danger.

727
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,120
It's amazingly elastic, isn't it? Look at that.

728
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,600
- I don't know what to do. 
- We will leave you to it, James.
- Yeah.

729
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,280
- It tastes delicious. 
- I don't know how to rectify this.

730
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,920
This might be one step too far.

731
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,960
OK, bakers, you've got 15 minutes to go in this,

732
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,040
your final Showstopper Challenge.

733
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,000
The final push of the Bake Off. Let's do it.

734
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,800
It could be tricky to balance on the chiffon.

735
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,840
Really, really tricky.

736
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,120
It's fairly stable.

737
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,680
We are a bit short of time. Rather than make the cross out of Turkish delight,

738
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,680
I made the cross out of raspberries.

739
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,960
My girlfriend said I was crazy for doing five cakes.

740
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,840
- What does Tartarus mean again? 
- The offspring of Chaos.
- I love that.

741
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,400
That's me!

742
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,760
There's five minutes, bakers.

743
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,560
Shall we take it to the wire yet again?

744
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,640
I've just got to be gentle.

745
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,000
And delicate.

746
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,360
It's going to be not delicate but presented.

747
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,840
Three, two, one. Bakers, that's it.

748
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:57,360
The Final Challenge in the 2012 Bake Off is done.

749
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,440
Step away from your Showstopper Challenges.

750
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,960
James!

751
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,200
If in doubt, cover it in icing sugar.

752
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,040
I am happy. I came, I saw, I baked.

753
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,760
Hopefully I conquered, who knows?

754
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,040
I think the winner could be James. Brendan has been consistent but James has the quality,

755
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,680
that edge to him. He has baked five massive cakes.

756
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,400
I think mine ultimately shows less skill than the others

757
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,040
but hopefully some good baking.

758
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:43,360
I think to achieve the title would be an extraordinary

759
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:49,000
endorsement of what I've achieved in...

760
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,720
Yes, in what I've achieved in my baking over the decades, really.

761
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,080
You know, in sp...

762
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,360
Quick, sabotage him while we can!

763
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,720
It's the final judging of The Great British Bake Off.

764
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,760
John, if you would like to bring heaven and hell to the altar.

765
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,480
Well done, John. Tell us all about it.

766
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,680
It's a chocolate and orange sponge base

767
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,800
and some ganache running through. The top cakes are individually injected with lemon curd,

768
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,280
rolled in marshmallow meringue and rolled in desiccated coconut.

769
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,560
Well, it really does look stunning.

770
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,760
We have a lovely shine on top.

771
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,960
You should be praised for the look of it.

772
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,720
- It's very professional.
- Thank you.

773
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,960
What I like about that cake is when you cut it,

774
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,240
and you see it on the plate, it looks beautiful.

775
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,080
It's got a lovely line where we've come through the icing,

776
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:50,320
the texture of the cake looks perfect.

777
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:21,200
It's rich. It's absolutely lovely. Mm.

778
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,080
That really works.

779
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,200
You've got a beautiful blend of the chocolate, it's quite difficult to do on a chiffon cake.

780
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,480
Add the chocolate and remain having a decent structure.

781
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,480
As you took the slice, Mary is right, it held together.

782
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,520
And you have a perfect slice of cake.

783
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,560
Now, that looks a nice even-textured light chiffon cake.

784
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:00,040
A lovely strong lemony flavour in the middle of that.

785
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,680
It's light, it's full of flavour, the coconut works well.

786
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,320
- Well done.
- Thank you very much.

787
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,760
Brendan, bring the family up.

788
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,680
I called it a family reunion cake.

789
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,600
The two dominant flavours are raspberry and almond.

790
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,520
The coating is a raspberry and very light mousseline light coating.

791
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,840
It's elegant, as always, Brendan you've been the constant.

792
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,280
And again, you've come up with another one.

793
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,960
I like the way you always go that extra mile.

794
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,520
You've made the raspberry jelly

795
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,800
and I'm glad it's not over decorated. I like simplicity.

796
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,800
Ooh, nice.

797
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:02,080
Ooh, that's worth reuniting with your family for!

798
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,240
You've got your layers beautifully even, as you always do.

799
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,680
It's got a nice bake all the way through it.

800
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,040
That sponge is like a cloud.

801
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:34,560
You get a hit of raspberry and the after effect is the almond coming through.

802
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,680
For the almond to come through and give you a hit of almond

803
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,800
but not overwhelm it is quite tricky.

804
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:45,480
It is absolutely delicious. And I love the fresh raspberry topping.

805
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:56,680
- The gingermen are gorgeous and delicate, crispy.
- Nice texture.

806
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:01,520
- It's so good.
- Not too much ginger in there but enough. Well done.

807
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,720
Thank you very much.

808
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,840
Well done, Brendan.

809
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,320
Five cakes, we've got a rose chiffon, a pistachio chiffon,

810
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:31,840
a vanilla chiffon with raspberry in and out and vanilla with blueberry.

811
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,080
There's plenty of cake for a party and we are having a fete

812
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:43,240
so you are the main contributor to our fete, thank you very much!

813
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,000
- Is that a good thing? 
- It's a very good thing.

814
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,240
I don't know what to say, really.

815
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,960
The problems for me is there's five individual cakes.

816
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,320
The criteria is to create a cake.

817
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,960
If you join them up somehow, join them up

818
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,160
so it became a sequence that joined together in one cake,

819
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,240
the problem is which one do you want us to judge?

820
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,640
To judge all five would be tricky.

821
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,840
- The Union Jack. 
- We will go for the middle one.

822
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:14,600
- This has got all the bits in. 
- Pistachio sponge.

823
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,840
I can taste the rose.

824
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,080
What am I going to say, James?

825
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,480
Bad crumb.

826
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,160
- It's far too dry.
- Is it?
- Hm.

827
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,880
- It's welding my mouth together, unfortunately.
- Oh, no.

828
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,080
It really is too cakey. It really should be light.

829
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,320
- Can we try England, Scotland? 
- Have a go for Scotland.

830
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,600
That one is slightly lighter but it still a bit cakey

831
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,000
and not light and spongy.

832
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,560
The density is too much.

833
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,040
It's got a beautiful flavour, better than the middle one.

834
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,880
- But the problem for me is the structure is wrong.
- Right, OK.

835
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,560
You've had such a lot to do in five cakes,

836
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:39,800
I think in fact if you'd made one big square one and then divided it

837
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:45,200
in sections as one cake you'd have had had more time to give a smarter finish.

838
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,640
We can still sort of see the cake coming through your covering.

839
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,520
It's a shame that, James.

840
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,080
As the finalists take their Showstoppers

841
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,680
to their guests at the fete,

842
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,640
Paul and Mary have a decision to make.

843
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:26,360
Let's look at them individually. Let's start with James first of all.

844
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:31,480
I think James has coped jolly well with all that's gone wrong

845
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:35,920
like we've always found in the Bake Off when disasters happen they cope.

846
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,840
They are all home bakers.

847
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,800
They don't make scenes and he smiled through the lot.

848
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,480
United Kingdom was his idea

849
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,760
and yet nothing was united about that at all.

850
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,200
He did well in the technical though. He came first yesterday.

851
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,520
He did well on the technical.

852
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,520
It's a shame James had such a difficult weekend

853
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,240
because if you look at the Star Bakers

854
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,600
he has won three times, Brendan twice and John once.

855
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,960
So, it all goes to show, as you've said many times,

856
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,040
it's hitting your stride the right moment.

857
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,560
- Which leads us on to John. 
- He started all right.

858
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,080
He did quite well the first few weeks.

859
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:13,800
- Then, he tailed off as if he had lost his mojo.
- He's very emotional.

860
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,480
He is and that dictates his bakes.

861
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,760
That glossy icing on top of the chocolate cake,

862
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,400
he said it would mirror.

863
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,960
It did mirror.

864
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,720
Let's talk about Brendan, Mr Consistency.

865
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:30,000
He was very good at things he could practise at home

866
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,080
like the Showstoppers and the Signature Bake.

867
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,960
But when it came to the technical, sometimes he didn't do so well.

868
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,480
But he was outstanding in all other fields.

869
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:46,960
His knowledge, his ability in making cakes, breads, unbelievable.

870
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:52,600
Do you know who you think deserves to be crowed Bake Off champion?

871
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:57,320
Do you know, we had a chat before and we both looked at each other

872
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,800
and said the same name.

873
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,200
- Really? Did you go one, two, three and...
- Like scissor, papers, stone.

874
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:09,480
- Not everyone decides things like we do.
- OK. We have agreed.
- Oh, tense.

875
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,000
Bakers, family, friends.

876
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,520
Welcome to another hypothermic British summer afternoon.

877
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,880
And to you, our lovely three finalists, what can I say?

878
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:37,720
You've given us whisky-soaked mega-bakes that made us feel like a Borrower in comparison, James.

879
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:41,600
Brendan, you've offered up psychedelic slices of perfection.

880
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:48,320
And John, you've created the iconic building from the decline and fall of the Roman Empire.

881
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,560
You are all brilliant and you should be incredibly proud of yourselves.

882
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:56,400
It's time for you to come forward. If our bakers could come forward.

883
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:07,000
So, Paul and Mary have made their decision and we are very, very pleased

884
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,200
to announce that the winner of the Great British Bake Off 2012 is...

885
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,600
John.

886
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

887
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,120
John was fantastic.

888
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,600
He's had his ups and downs through the whole series

889
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,400
but overall when he nails it, he absolutely nailed it

890
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,440
and today that was fantastic.

891
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:50,840
He showed us that he could bake to an exceedingly high standard.

892
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:55,720
He knows how to design a cake, he has a modern twist.

893
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,680
His thought processes,

894
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:02,480
his design and baking for the first time is joined up.

895
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:07,800
And the passion the guy has is just phenomenal. I'm very proud of him.

896
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,440
He did exceptionally well.

897
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,880
- Is this real?
- It's very real.

898
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,440
In a minute, your blood pressure will come down to normal.

899
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:22,960
I feel faint, really, really queasy. It's not sinking in.

900
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,240
I cannot believe it. I really cannot believe it, I'm so happy.

901
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:31,360
I was a reluctant applicant when I filled out the application form,

902
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:35,720
but I'm really pleased I did it because I am self taught

903
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,040
and it's been great to take it to this level.

904
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,400
So, that in particular now I will value and hold onto really.

905
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,680
It does genuinely feel like everyone's a winner.

906
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,920
It feels brilliant. There's no real commiserations going around.

907
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,800
It's all congratulations, well done. A really fun atmosphere.

908
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,480
Overall, one of the best experiences of my life.

909
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,120
I'm not going to be a banker!

910
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:14,920
My mum is so proud. That's the biggest prize I've got. My mum is happy with me and...

911
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:21,480
I just feel like I've finally done something that I've wanted to do to please her.

912
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:26,680
Do you know what I mean? It just means the absolute world to me.

913
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,360
Oh, God. Shut up, John!
