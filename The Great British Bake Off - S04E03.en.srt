1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Week three and we've no idea what our 11 bakers have in store for us. 

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,680
Mainly cos they've issued injunctions. 

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,840
More importantly, we don't know what Mary and Paul 

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,800
have got in store for the bakers, 

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,840
but it's bound to be blue-eyed and a little bit harsh. 

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,920
Welcome to The Great British Bake Off. 

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,080
Last time... 

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,440
Love the dough. 

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,560
..bread week saw Frances deliver on style yet again... 

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,200
I think the box is fantastic. 

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,480
..but lacked substance. 

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,320
I could take a little bit more ginger. 

13
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,920
Rob's usual precision... 

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,040
No. Needs more. 

15
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,320
..sank without trace. 

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,040
It's a Paul the psychic octopus tribute loaf. 

17
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,080
Of course it is. 

18
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,280
Howard... 

19
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,560
Paul would probably like a larger muffin. 

20
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,040
..and Beca only just scraped through. 

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,360
I am so NOT ready to go. 

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,600
Ugh! 

23
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,400
But Lucy's simple loaf was her last Bake Off bake... 

24
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,880
That's the way the breadstick snaps. 

25
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,160
..and Ruby shone as Star Baker. 

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,240
I can't believe I did it. 

27
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,360
Now the bakers face desserts... 

28
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,640
It's like school dinners gone wrong. 

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,800
HE GROANS 

30
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,560
..a Signature Challenge that has layer upon layer of pressure... 

31
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,280
Almost there. Come on, Ali. 

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,320
..Mary's second and most delicate technical bake... 

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,840
They're not really very ball-like, are they? 

34
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,160
That's a bit knitty. 

35
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,560
..a Showstopper featuring over 250 mini-mouthfuls of perfection... 

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,320
I'm just doing as much stuff as I can 

37
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,360
on the smallest cake in the world, basically. 

38
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,040
..a decision that could change everything... 

39
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,120
Will you lose one or two bakers today? 

40
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,200
Wait and see. 

41
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,600
..and for the first time in Bake Off history... 

42
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,880
I can't do this. 

43
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,480
..there is a baking burglary! 

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,400
Where's my custard? 

45
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,960
Oh, no! 

46
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,160
HE WHISTLES NONCHALANTLY 

47
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,960
So, they've done cakes, they've done bread... 

48
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,240
This week, it's all about stressed. 

49
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,400
Stressed? 

50
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,040
"Desserts" backwards. 

51
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,240
- Oh, very good. You know what Victoria sponge is backwards?
- No. 

52
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,160
It's egnops airotciv, which is actually Latvian for Mary Berry. 

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,720
Wow. 

54
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,760
I love making desserts, 

55
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,600
imaginative desserts, I'm quite excited about this week. 

56
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,080
Last weekend's Star Baker. It's only going to go downhill. 

57
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,680
Last weekend was a bit mental. 

58
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,840
My friends and family have all been saying to me 

59
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,000
this week that they are really proud and that I should just enjoy it. 

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,760
Even me at my best, I'm worried I'm still not good enough 

61
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,040
compared to everyone else. 

62
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,200
I didn't know where I stand. I'm here. 

63
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,600
I'm still here, and that's fantastic! 

64
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,320
Morning, bakers, and welcome back to the Bake Off tent. Now... 

65
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,640
this morning is a Signature Challenge. 

66
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,920
Paul and Mary would really love you to make your favourite trifle. 

67
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,760
It's all about the layers today, bakers. 

68
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,080
We're talking sponge, biscuit, fruit, custard, 

69
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,680
whatever you want, but Mary and Paul would like defined layers. 

70
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,240
They're not TRIFLING with you. 

71
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,800
So, bakers, on your marks... 

72
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,760
- Get set...
- BOTH: Bake! 

73
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,080
Trifle is a classic British dessert with a 400-year history. 

74
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,440
This is tried and tested in the family over several years. 

75
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,000
In the past few weeks I've probably made it about five or six times. 

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,440
I think I've just got a really reliable recipe. It always works. 

77
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,280
Although it sounds simple, this is the first time 

78
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,000
in this year's competition that Paul and Mary have set a challenge 

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,480
that tests the bakers' ability to multitask under huge time pressure. 

80
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,520
So the first layer, it could be a cake, a biscuit, a sponge.... 

81
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,000
Once they've mastered that, they've got to think of fillings that go on top. 

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,520
Each one of those things brings an inherent problem - 

83
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,920
A, with technique, but, B, with timing. 

84
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,160
A trifle has got to have compatible flavours. 

85
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,240
If one is too strong, it'll overpower the other, 

86
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,320
and also, textures - classically, a trifle is soft all the way through. 

87
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,920
Some of them may be clever enough to put something crispy on top. 

88
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,360
To put all those layers together 

89
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,560
and let those levels be seen is extremely difficult. 

90
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,560
The bakers have just three hours. 

91
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,800
170 of caster sugar... 

92
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,400
Most of them have gone for a traditional base of ladyfingers... 

93
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,080
..biscuits made from strips of light, fatless sponge. 

94
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,800
I was googling recipes of trifles 

95
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,640
and ladyfingers popped up quite often. 

96
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,520
I wanted to try and stay true 

97
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,320
to an original English trifle. 

98
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,240
While at university, Ali succeeded in raising 

99
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,280
thousands of pounds for charity by selling his baking. 

100
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,760
But his signature trifle never featured. 

101
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,880
It's a coconut, raspberry and lemon meringue trifle 

102
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,560
topped with macaroons. 

103
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,320
I'm hoping if I add some technical elements, they'll be like, 

104
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,160
"Wow! You've managed to fit all that in in three hours." 

105
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,560
Before preparing for this challenge, 

106
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,280
Ali had never made a trifle 

107
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,800
or even tasted one. 

108
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,200
90% of the stuff I've baked on the Bake Off 

109
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,680
I've never baked before. Some I haven't even heard of before. 

110
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,960
Glenn is no stranger to trifle... 

111
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,400
I had got a minor blockage. 

112
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,560
..but his ladyfingers look a little unfamiliar. 

113
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,280
I'm piping them into rounds. 

114
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,440
I'll put one on top of the other in the bowl 

115
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,480
and it will hopefully give us nice distinct layers. 

116
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,160
(Your normal cake's a lot easier.) 

117
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,560
Glenn constantly challenges himself to bake things at home 

118
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,600
that are more original than those he sees in shops or restaurants. 

119
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,920
Give me five. 

120
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,840
Good girl. 

121
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,240
But he's going to work hard to top the original version of his trifle. 

122
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,000
The best trifle I ever had was made by a friend who 

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,920
made your raspberry and almond trifle from... 

124
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,440
- I think she got it off Woman's Hour, or something.
- Creep. 

125
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,120
So, I haven't pinched your recipe, 

126
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,520
but I have pinched your flavour combination. 

127
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,240
Just to make life a little bit harder for herself... 

128
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,400
I do have some tricks up my sleeve. 

129
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,200
..Ruby's trifle features ladyfingers and a jammy sponge base. 

130
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,880
I'm going to be making a tropical trifle. 

131
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,920
I've not really practised it in its entirety...well, I have, 

132
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,920
but in a plastic mixing bowl, so 

133
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,120
in a proper crystal dish it's going to be a completely different story. 

134
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,360
Ruby is an inventive baker, 

135
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,200
but studying for her first-year philosophy exams 

136
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,920
has left her little time to practise. 

137
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,280
Her desert island trifle is flavoured with rum, coconut 

138
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,160
and cardamom, and filled with fresh bananas, strawberries and mangos. 

139
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,120
I've got a genoise as well, that's going to form a palm tree silhouette 

140
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,880
round the side of the bowl. 

141
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,520
Wait a minute - you're having a palm tree and some fingers as well? 

142
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,080
- Yes, in the bottom of the bowl. 
- You've got a lot to do.
- I do, I do! 

143
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,080
Some bakers have decided against the classic ladyfingers base. 

144
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,400
It's a homemade ginger cake. It's got three different types of ginger in it 

145
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,600
so it's got ground ginger, stem ginger and candied ginger. 

146
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,240
Hoping to add more flavour by opting for a cake-based trifle... 

147
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,520
It's funny - the three of us at the back here are doing ginger 

148
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,200
with a fruit combination. 

149
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,120
Peach, almond and ginger was something that I just had in mind 

150
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,160
and I didn't have the opportunity to make until...now. 

151
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,240
And Deborah is straying even further from tradition. 

152
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,720
I'm doing lemon swiss roll with my own curd. 

153
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,000
It looks really pretty and the flavours work really well. 

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,400
Deborah lives in Peterborough with her husband David and son Jeremy. 

155
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,800
When she bakes for them, 

156
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,160
what starts out as traditional often ends up with a very modern twist. 

157
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,040
Her trifle is flavoured with orange, lemon and mango, 

158
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,640
and infused with orange liqueur, deployed with a secret weapon. 

159
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,160
- I'm going to spray it onto the sponge.
- How do you spray it? 

160
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,440
- With a garden sprayer? Oh, good! 
- Like this and then. 

161
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,440
- Oh, clever!
- Let's have a look. What's in there?
- Cointreau... 

162
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,680
- I can't believe you just did that! 
- Here. 

163
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,880
Oh, that's lovely! 

164
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,400
Oh, it's delicious. 

165
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,360
- Isn't it? 
- That's it now, she's gone. 

166
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,440
I like the idea of the lemon swiss roll. 

167
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,200
I obviously slice it 

168
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,520
so you can see the spirals through the glass, hopefully. 

169
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,840
THEY ALL LAUGH 

170
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,880
- Thank you very much.
- OK. 

171
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,000
Two hours remaining. 

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,560
Got to get these in. 

173
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,720
Baking a trifle base presents a unique challenge. 

174
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,840
Boudoir biscuits in. 

175
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,280
As it's traditionally soaked in alcohol afterwards, it needs 

176
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,280
to be just firm enough to absorb the liquid without disintegrating. 

177
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,400
- Not quite.
- Knowing you, you've got 500 things going on. 

178
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,920
I've got a million things going on 

179
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,240
and I forget what I'm meant to be focusing on. 

180
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,600
- The biscuits are in - that's good. 
- That's something, yeah. 

181
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,200
Trifle tradition now gives way to heated controversy. 

182
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,960
I've got a mixture of Bramley and dessert apples 

183
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,600
and then cinnamon sugar. 

184
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,160
Should the next layer be jam... 

185
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,760
500g of raspberries, 500g of sugar. 

186
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,920
In about 15 minutes, at a steady boil, that will turn into jam. 

187
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,520
..or jelly? 

188
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,000
I am making my own jelly from peach nectar and gelatine sheets, 

189
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,600
so they're soaking here. 

190
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,240
I am not a great fan of jelly. 

191
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,760
It's just not my cup of tea. 

192
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,720
Oh! I'm sorry, you can't have trifle without jelly. 

193
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,720
I am using fresh oranges to make the jelly, 

194
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,560
it's really refreshing, actually, 

195
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,280
and it's a nice combination, with the ginger. 

196
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,720
For Beca, baking is all about family, 

197
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,200
as she was taught by her two grandmothers and her mum. 

198
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,040
Nice! Oh! 

199
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,720
Her orange and ginger trifle is a recipe that Beca inherited, 

200
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,520
and has adapted for Bake Off. 

201
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,160
I was brought up on trifle, 

202
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,480
it's a staple in West Wales - trifle. 

203
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,800
After your Sunday roast, which you get nearly every day of the week, 

204
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,560
you have trifle. 

205
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,600
My jam is nearly there... 

206
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,280
a couple of seconds... 

207
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,960
I've been practising this at home for a couple of weeks, 

208
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,000
but we're all trifled out at home. 

209
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,280
Christine has been married to Rob for 31 years 

210
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,520
and when they aren't working together at their 

211
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,160
engraving business, he helps her perfect her baking. 

212
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,000
Christine's pina colada trifle with mango jam, coconut custard 

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,600
and rum syrup is one of Rob's personal favourites. 

214
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,760
My husband is really enjoying me being on the Bake Off 

215
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,200
because he just loves his food. 

216
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,400
Shall I just try that? 

217
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,760
Shall I just try another one, make sure it's OK? 

218
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,080
OK, bakers, one hour to go. One hour left. 

219
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,280
Argh! I just got ingredients everywhere. This is chaos, kids. 

220
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,320
This is why you organise your space better. 

221
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,200
They're fine. Five minutes in the tin. Go. 

222
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,320
Oops. That was close. 

223
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,200
Nearly lost the lot. 

224
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,600
Caught a little bit at the edges, but I think it's OK. 

225
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,480
Little bit of a dip in the middle. Not too worried. 

226
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,560
I've had a worst dip! 

227
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,320
While their bases cool, the bakers make creme anglaise - 

228
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
or custard - from scratch. 

229
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,920
Is custard the scary layer? 

230
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,560
For me, yeah. It's always been difficult for me, 

231
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,120
but I've been shown this week how to do it and I practised 

232
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,200
- and practised it...
- Foolproof! 

233
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,320
Mark has only had to nip out to the back garden 

234
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,520
to get the eggs for his custard practice, 

235
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,400
and his ginger, mango and passion fruit trifle 

236
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,960
features custard flavoured with dark rum. 

237
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,880
- What have you got in here? 
- Egg yolks and caster sugar. 

238
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,000
- And you've whisked it?
- To blend. 

239
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,320
To blend, with a bit of cornflour. 

240
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,600
- Ah, you've got cornflour in there. 
- Yeah.
- OK. 

241
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,240
What's the problem? 

242
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,160
- That's not the method I would do. Put it that way.
- OK.
- OK. 

243
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,960
Perfect creme anglaise is a mixture of egg yolk and sugar 

244
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,640
carefully combined with warm milk and infused with vanilla. 

245
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,600
It needs to be quite sort of thick, not too sloppy. 

246
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,280
The heat from the milk should be enough to thicken the custard 

247
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,440
without the need for cornflour. 

248
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,520
I'm making a custard out of coconut milk. 

249
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,320
It needs the cornflour to thicken it 

250
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,440
because I can't afford to have a runny custard. 

251
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,480
But too much heat and the mixture will split into a useless mess. 

252
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,720
This needs to be done again. 

253
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,040
This is an ex-custard. 

254
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,560
It's like school dinners gone wrong. 

255
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,280
HE GROANS 

256
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,840
- What custard are you doing? 
- Just vanilla.
- Yeah. 

257
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,920
- It's taking ages. 
- It is, isn't it? 

258
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,200
I'm getting impatient. 

259
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,000
I got loads to do yet. 

260
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,960
I've got to make that into proper custard, 

261
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,600
I've got two types of caramel to make... 

262
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,320
so...yeah. 

263
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,000
HE WHIMPERS 

264
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,560
Howard is a keen jogger when he's not baking. 

265
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,600
He spent weeks perfecting a caramel and apple trifle, 

266
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,680
topped with macadamia nuts. 

267
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,680
You are doing the true creme anglaise with just egg yolk. 

268
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,200
- That's right. 
- So, no cornflour?
- No cornflour. 

269
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,840
So, you're being the bravest of everybody here, and I wish you good luck. 

270
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,400
I've curdled it again! 

271
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,000
I've got scrambled eggs. 

272
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,520
HE SIGHS 

273
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,280
Actually, I might be overreacting. I think it might be fine. 

274
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,640
It was just thickening unevenly. 

275
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,880
While their custard is cooling in the fridge... 

276
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,520
I wouldn't normally put biscuits on top but... 

277
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,880
..some bakers have chosen to use the time to make 

278
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,560
toppings for their trifle. 

279
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,600
Going in! 

280
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,480
I'm making amaretti biscuits 

281
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,840
and they will go on top of the trifle. 

282
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,640
Kimberley's drive to perfect original baking recipes 

283
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,800
has to compete with her passion for salsa dancing. 

284
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,720
The amaretti biscuits decorating her peach, almond and ginger trifle 

285
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,400
also have competition. 

286
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,720
Either something has melted or that's honeycomb. 

287
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,640
- That's honeycomb. 
- That's honeycomb. 

288
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,080
Oh, that looks gorgeous. 

289
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,800
That's quite good, actually. 

290
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,600
Readers, I married her! That's amazing. 

291
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,000
With his first ever trifle recipe... 

292
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,040
Ah, they're about the same size. 

293
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,120
..Ali is hoping to go one better. 

294
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,840
No-one likes a soggy macaroon. 

295
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,880
His trifle will be topped with lemon macaroons. 

296
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,600
If that doesn't impress them, I don't know what will. 

297
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,880
So this is my attempt to be a contender. 

298
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,320
OK, bakers, time to start getting those ladyfingers in a bowl. 

299
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,880
Each layer in the bakers' Signature trifle must be distinct. 

300
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,960
I hate trying to put square things into round things. 

301
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,280
I'm as surprised as anyone else that this is actually working. 

302
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,920
Key to the trifle's success is creating an attractive design 

303
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,000
against the sides of the glass bowl before adding the custard. 

304
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,760
Where is my custard? 

305
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,920
Oh, no! 

306
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,160
I'm so sorry, Howard. 

307
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,080
What's happened? 

308
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,480
I used Howard's custard by error. We were both in the same fridge 

309
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,280
and I forgot what my bowl was, and I've used his. 

310
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,520
- I haven't used it all, but I am really upset.
- Howard, this is... 

311
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,600
It's like a recurring nightmare... 

312
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,640
So, now that you've taken possession of Deborah's custard. 

313
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,280
- And his own. I'm really sorry. 
- I've got some of my own. 

314
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,440
It's either a terrible error or the most incredible case of 

315
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,400
- baking espionage I've ever seen. 
- I'm really sorry. 

316
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,040
I'm sure that one custard is as good as another. 

317
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,560
One love, one custard. 

318
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,320
OK, bakers, get those ladyfingers soggy. It's just five minutes... 

319
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,760
Oh, no! 

320
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,200
I'm happy, cos they were my biggest worry. 

321
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,960
I just want some crushed meringue around the edge 

322
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,280
and a bit in the middle. 

323
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Almost there. Come on, Ali. 

324
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,640
(Where's the spoon when you need one?) 

325
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,520
What are you looking for, Howard? 

326
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,320
- A spoon.
- What sort? A dessertspoon? I will get you one.
- Thank you. 

327
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,080
- Spoons? 
- There are no spoons in there. 

328
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,040
Right. Will a knife do? A palette knife? 

329
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,240
Thank you. 

330
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,880
This is the first time I've ever used a blowtorch. Oh, wow! 

331
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,160
This is fun! 

332
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,760
Triflers, that is it. 

333
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,680
Please stop trifling around now. 

334
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,360
The bake's over, step away. 

335
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,320
All the signature trifles will now be judged by Mary and Paul. 

336
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,480
I love what you've done to these palm trees. 

337
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,600
You can actually see the sand. It's set up almost like a scene. 

338
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,720
I can taste the coconut. And the sponge has kept its texture. 

339
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,120
I love the flavour a lot. The coconut, the sponge. 

340
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,800
I think a shallower dish spread out a bit more, 

341
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,120
and then you get a bit of every flavour. 

342
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,640
OK, we've got some layers going on. 

343
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,040
Could you have got any more in there(?) 

344
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,440
I did wonder, when I saw the dish, how I was going to 

345
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,040
maintain my reputation of doing truly massive bakes. 

346
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,280
- You have.
- You have. I don't think anyone could beat that. 

347
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,480
I actually heard suction then. 

348
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,360
Actually, there was. It was extraordinary. 

349
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,320
It nearly took his arm off. 

350
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,520
I think the creme pat is good. It is holding well. 

351
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,160
And you have just got the right amount of soaking of the sponge. 

352
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,240
The definition, actually, in the layers are very good. 

353
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,600
I love the idea of the top. 

354
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,160
Those little almond biscuits and honeycomb. 

355
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,880
- I wouldn't have thought of it myself but it goes very well.
- Thank you. 

356
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,600
To me, the custard layer is rather thick. 

357
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,360
All I'm getting is the orange liqueur 

358
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,280
and the orange, rather than the rhubarb. 

359
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,040
- It takes some doing, overpowering rhubarb.
- Yes, but you managed to do it! 

360
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,080
Probably a thinner layer of the cake underneath. 

361
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,240
That's really sort of cake with fruit on top, on custard. 

362
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,960
The custard is very slack, it needs to be thicker. 

363
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,040
I think it's probably slightly over decorated. 

364
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,400
The crunch on the top, maybe even just a line of it 

365
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,200
inside the cream, would have been nicer, rather than on the top. 

366
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,160
A little bit less custard, a little bit less cream - perfect. 

367
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,960
You were clever to think of doing the jelly in two different tins. 

368
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,280
The jelly is lovely. 

369
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,320
The problem is the custard is quite slack, 

370
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,080
so what you've technically got is a ginger cake with a bit of jelly. 

371
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,720
Quite ambitious to make those macaroons on the top. 

372
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,720
You've sort of done traditional but a bit of a twist with it. 

373
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,080
I'm finding something to have a go at. 

374
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,680
You've just over-filled it. 

375
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,480
The macaroon's got chewiness to it. 

376
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,720
The sponges at the bottom are beautifully soaked, 

377
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,800
they are nice and soft. The cream is excellent. 

378
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,520
There's sharpness coming from the lemon and the raspberry... 

379
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,560
- That's a nice trifle.
- That's good. 
- Thank you. 

380
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,600
It looks most pleasing and attractive, doesn't it? And fun. 

381
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,280
That's a pina colada, for sure. Even the little taste of Malibu 

382
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,800
as well, just the right amount, 

383
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,160
but the flavour of the sponge as well, the flavours of the fruit... 

384
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,480
the overall flavour and look of it is superb. 

385
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,160
I ended up using Howard's custard. 

386
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,400
That's a great custard. 

387
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,280
So, your custard, if I remember, you had a little cornflour. 

388
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,040
- I did.
- ..whereas Howard did his... and no cornflour. 

389
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,440
We'll taste it first and then I want to taste 

390
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,520
the custard separate as well... 

391
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,360
- The custard's good, Howard. 
- Well done, Howard. 

392
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,320
- Overall, the flavours are fantastic. 
- Thank you. 

393
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,600
If the swiss roll hadn't been quite as soaked, 

394
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,400
it would have held together. 

395
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,480
So we're now moving on to Howard and we'll just see how your custard 

396
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,840
- tastes compared with Howard's. 
- Thank you. 

397
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,360
- The definition is not there in the layers, that's for sure.
- OK. 

398
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,400
OK, I can see an issue immediately. 

399
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,000
This is more liquid, I think. 

400
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,080
The custard is definitely more liquid. 

401
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,000
SHE SIGHS 

402
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,280
All the flavours blend really well together. 

403
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,520
I do not like the skin on the apple. 

404
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,960
Shall we get Deborah over to account for her custard? 

405
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,480
Do you want to come over, Deborah? 

406
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,840
What do you make of the custard? 

407
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,840
The custard is far too slack. Yours was a better custard, Howard. 

408
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,120
Yours needed cooking out more 

409
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,240
- but I think you'd still have a problem with the layers, to be honest.
- Yeah. 

410
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,840
At some stage during The Great British Bake Off, 

411
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,000
I might actually do a whole thing 

412
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,320
that is good, as opposed to just elements. 

413
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,960
I'd just like to get one uneventful bake out of the way. 

414
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,520
Each time I get good feedback, 

415
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,640
it just proves to me that I am not idiot. 

416
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,640
Paul said he was trying to find fault in it 

417
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,400
and the only fault he could find was that there was too much of it. 

418
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,240
More is more, when it's trifle. 

419
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,800
The humble trifle may be one of Britain's most popular puddings. 

420
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,560
It wasn't always the way. 

421
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,200
It used to be the exclusive preserve of the aristocracy, 

422
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,840
until one woman pioneered trifle for the masses. 

423
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,720
The Georgian era was a time of rapid economic growth, which brought 

424
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,320
with it an upwardly mobile middle class. 

425
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,720
These social climbers were eager to emulate the opulent lifestyle 

426
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,800
of the aristocracy, especially when it came to fine dining. 

427
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,840
It took one pioneering cookery writer to rescue these 

428
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,160
aspirational middle classes, 

429
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,080
and her name was Hannah Glass. 

430
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,360
Hannah was born into a wealthy family, 

431
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,320
but ran away aged 16 to marry a soldier. 

432
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,240
Living in reduced circumstances, she wanted to re-create 

433
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,880
the tastes of the aristocracy. 

434
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,920
Using all the money she had, she wrote a recipe book that 

435
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,400
revolutionised dining for the middle classes. 

436
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,400
So, Lucy, why do you think The Art Of Cookery was such a huge success? 

437
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,880
Lots of early recipe books were written by 

438
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,120
quite grand male chefs. 

439
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,080
The recipes were a jumble, and she wanted very, very clear sizes 

440
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,600
and measurements, whether it was using as much thyme, 

441
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,120
- the herb, that would sit on a sixpence...
- Oh, sweet. 

442
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,920
..or using a piece of butter as big as a walnut. 

443
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,120
So, if you had a servant girl, you could have educated her 

444
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,600
quite quickly on how to prepare a relatively complicated dish. 

445
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,040
You could put on a very a good show from Hannah's book, 

446
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,880
which I think, given the circumstances of her own life, 

447
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,520
coming from quite a good background, 

448
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,680
that would have been a pre-occupation for her 

449
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,120
as well as many thousands of women in London at the time - 

450
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,600
how to appear richer than you are, essentially. 

451
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,920
The most popular pages of the book were those devoted to 

452
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,640
her spectacular trifle. 

453
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,840
Now, trifle was already popular in Georgian Britain, 

454
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,440
but in 1760, Hannah took it to another level 

455
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,720
by introducing a revolutionary new, extra element - jelly. 

456
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,640
Difficult to make, jelly had been enjoyed 

457
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,840
exclusively by the upper classes 

458
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,080
and required an ingredient that may seem rather unappealing to 

459
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,600
modern taste buds. 

460
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,680
Out of the corner of my eye, Jean, I'm spotting a hoof. 

461
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,520
It's a calf foot. 

462
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,040
I think she was the first that actually made a dessert using 

463
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,240
- cows' feet as jelly. 
- And is it one foot per one trifle? 

464
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,280
Hannah Glass says four. 

465
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,880
- Four feet?!
- Yes, four feet. 

466
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,680
I mean, that would be a caldron full. 

467
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,560
Making calf's foot jelly involved many stages 

468
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,840
and would have been a challenge for an uneducated servant, 

469
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,600
but Hannah demystified the process with clear and concise instructions. 

470
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,400
Look at the spoon going in there! 

471
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,720
So, that would have been the consistency... 

472
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,320
of the jelly in the trifle. 

473
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,280
Yes, it's not quite what we're used to these days, is it? 

474
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,080
There's quite a calf-y smell coming off there, Jean, 

475
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,160
- I'm not going to lie to you. 
- Yes, but it doesn't taste that bad. 

476
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,240
It doesn't taste that meaty. 

477
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,040
Hannah instructs her ambitious readers to build up the layers of 

478
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,600
the trifle as high as possible until it is fit to go on the king's table. 

479
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,520
So, the moment of truth - would you like to try some? 

480
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,480
I can't get over in my mind that I'm about to eat a calf's foot. 

481
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,640
- I think you'll find it tastes quite nice.
- OK. 

482
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,440
JEAN LAUGHS 

483
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,280
That's delicious, Jean. 

484
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,160
You can lick the plate, if you like. 

485
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,600
I'd put on a lot of weight in Georgian times, I'm telling you. 

486
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,440
For their second challenge, 

487
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,400
the bakers have no idea which dessert they'll be asked to make. 

488
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,840
Here we all are, technical challenge time. 

489
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,160
Just to let you know, this is one of Mary's recipes. 

490
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,000
We don't want them to find out what you're doing, 

491
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,120
so, Paul and Mary, please leave. 

492
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,960
So, for today's challenge, we would like you to make 

493
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,680
iles flottantes, or floating islands, 

494
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,560
which are, of course, little tiny poached meringues, 

495
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,840
light and fluffy, in a sea of creme anglaise 

496
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,280
and topped with spun sugar. 

497
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,800
You have an hour-and-a-half to make these, so on your marks... 

498
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,960
- Get set...
- Bake! 

499
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,800
Iles flottantes are often referred to as "snow eggs"... 

500
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,400
Why would you even float a meringue on custard? 

501
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,400
..due to the colour of the dessert's fluffy meringues 

502
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,880
and their distinctive shapes. 

503
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,520
I haven't made it before, but I know what it should 

504
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,520
look like, which is always helpful. 

505
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,280
So, Paul, floating islands. 

506
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,520
I think you should have a taste. 

507
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,880
They really look so delicate. 

508
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,880
The actual meringue itself - cooked right through, evenly. 

509
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,520
For me, it's all about textures. 

510
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,560
You've got that creamy creme anglaise, 

511
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,360
you've got almost marshmallow-like meringue 

512
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,840
that just melts in the mouth 

513
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,360
and then you hit that little bit of crunch coming from 

514
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,360
the sugar-work on the top. 

515
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,640
It really is a difficult technical bake. 

516
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,080
I think they'll have trouble with that meringue. 

517
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,160
I am going to be fascinated to see what they're going to come up with. 

518
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,920
Never made floating islands before. 

519
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,000
I heard of it before and I've eaten one before. I really love them. 

520
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,280
Mary's recipe only contains very basic instructions. 

521
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,120
(Make the meringue...) 

522
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,440
I've made them before, I've eaten them before. 

523
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,080
I'm feeling quite lucky. 

524
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,600
The key to a good meringue is 

525
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,160
not to over-whip the whites in the first place, 

526
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,480
so they just hold their shape. Not overdone. 

527
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,680
Oh, I've split the egg. No, I haven't. 

528
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,200
I think one of the shells has just poked into one of the yolks 

529
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,840
because I got egg yolk on my hands and one of them has split. 

530
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,840
So, start again. Schoolboy error. 

531
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,600
You want to make sure that all the sugar is properly incorporated 

532
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,840
and that's it gets a chance to break down and 

533
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,960
if you add it all too quickly, you can deflate the meringue. 

534
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,600
That way you get a nice, shiny... 

535
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,120
stiff meringue, which it has to be 

536
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,600
to do these, because you want a shape. 

537
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,000
If the French meringue isn't stiff... 

538
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,200
Nice and firm. 

539
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,640
..when it's poached, it will disintegrate. 

540
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,520
Do I dare? 

541
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,160
That's a firm meringue. 

542
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,360
The meringue then needs to be shaped... 

543
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,120
I don't want to do the first one. 

544
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,360
I'm going to wait until someone else does it, see how they do it. 

545
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,360
..using a delicate technique called quenelling. 

546
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,440
They are meant to look like three-sided spoon shapes. 

547
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,160
Three of them together. 

548
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,640
I think they ought to be a bit stiffer than this, 

549
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,480
but I will have to work with it. 

550
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,040
I think the reason this is looking so ugly is 

551
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,080
because I am trying to make it too big. 

552
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,800
Is that big enough? 

553
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,480
Cos it says to make six. 

554
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,600
But that's the size of the spoon. 

555
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,640
I'm seeing Beca do it. 

556
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,920
She has quite big ones... 

557
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,800
Uh, big quenelles. 

558
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,080
One hour remaining. 

559
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,560
It just says here.... 

560
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,480
SHE MUMBLES 

561
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,720
Poach in the milk. 

562
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,040
Poach in the milk. 

563
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,200
Mary hasn't specified a pan size, 

564
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,720
cooking temperature or duration. 

565
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,760
Everyone seems to be using either this pan... 

566
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,600
..or this pan. No-one is using that pan. 

567
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,960
Hmm. 

568
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,680
I've changed the pan and I've gone for the wider one, 

569
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,160
and I've put the lid on it and 

570
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,600
although I don't want the milk and cream to boil, 

571
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,600
I'm hoping there will be enough heat to cook the top of the meringue. 

572
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,520
I think I'll have it on quite a moderate heat myself, 

573
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,880
because you'd normally do meringues in the oven at quite a low heat. 

574
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,080
I feel like I am in meringue no-man's-land right now... 

575
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,600
Oh, dear. He's gone wrong. 

576
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,560
Well, I'm not sure that I'm meant to turn them. 

577
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,280
I think, they should just cook through. 

578
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,640
Agh! I can't turn it over. 

579
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,280
I might be all wrong here, but I don't really want to flip them over. 

580
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,000
These are one giant mass. 

581
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,720
I have to do some more, surely. 

582
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,360
No, yours are the right size. Trust me. 

583
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,960
I've got to redo that one. 

584
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,080
I'm concerned about getting them cooked, but 

585
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,360
I don't want it to be rubbery if I overcook it. 

586
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,200
I feel that they're firm and that they feel firm throughout. 

587
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,320
I don't think that's cooked. 

588
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,760
Now, you've gone for, I think, 

589
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,320
a metaphor for climate change. 

590
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,440
Maybe they weren't poached long enough or... 

591
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,680
- That custard is now boiling, isn't it?
- Yeah. 

592
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,480
- All I know about custard is that's not a good thing, is it?
- No. 

593
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,200
Oh, my God, this is genius. 

594
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,520
I am now... 

595
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,000
..sculpting my quenelle so it's the right size. 

596
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,160
I'm starting again cos I'm not happy with those. 

597
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,400
I am not sure how confident I feel about being able to finish it. 

598
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,080
While all the other bakers' quenelles cool, 

599
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,240
they should make a creme anglaise from the poaching milk 

600
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,920
and leftover egg yolks. 

601
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,640
That's just milk and cream strained. I've taken the meringue pieces out. 

602
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,000
Hi, Deborah. I suppose the big question is, is this your custard 

603
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,160
or is it Howard's custard? 

604
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,800
Or have you just gone off piste now 

605
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,280
and just, I don't know, gone for Rob's custard? 

606
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,080
- Whoever is doing the best! 
- No-one is safe around you. 

607
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,520
OK, bakers, 15 minutes of floating languidly until you come ashore. 

608
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,720
They are definitely better. 

609
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,280
Make spun sugar. 

610
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,680
I'm heating the sugar so it sticks to the back of the spoon. 

611
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,080
I don't know what I do with it. 

612
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,000
I don't know what temperature it's to be at. 

613
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,480
It's got to get to the stage where it's forming strings 

614
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,080
as it drops off the spoon. 

615
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,960
And then with a bit of luck... 

616
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,920
- Do you know what temperature it's supposed to be?
- Absolutely not. 

617
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,120
It's getting there. It's getting longer. 

618
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,040
No, that's not right. 

619
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,440
- That's one strand.
- That's spun sugar - what you talking about?! 

620
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,000
The key to spun sugar is to work fast. 

621
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,360
I'm just seeing if it'll...no. 

622
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,720
It's working, isn't it? 

623
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,560
Before it cools and hardens, the sugar should be flicked 

624
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,040
back and forth across a greaseproof surface. 

625
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,280
I'm just going to have to make do with flat spun sugar. 

626
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,880
I'm going to try the "wiggly between two dangly things" technique. 

627
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,840
- Oh, is that a technical term(?) 
- That's the approved technique. 

628
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,040
Oh, look, I've got four strands - count them, four strands! 

629
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,720
OK, bakers, whatever you've done - 

630
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,640
Shetland, Hebrides, Outer Hebrides, Lundy. It doesn't matter. 

631
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,080
- Just get them floating. You've got five minutes.
- Come on... 

632
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,280
Living dangerously here cos I've got two things on probably higher than 

633
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,320
they ought to be, both the sugar for the spun sugar, and this custard. 

634
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,120
That's burnt, isn't it? 

635
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,520
We need to reach a ribbon. 

636
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,720
Look at the wee droplets. 

637
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,880
Ooh! 

638
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,800
Make it into a ball. 

639
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,240
You're a clever sausage! Now, just five more of those, please. 

640
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,680
They are not really very ball-like, are they? 

641
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,280
That's a bit knitty. 

642
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,360
Oh! 

643
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,960
OK, you spin doctors, time is up. 

644
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,080
So, if you'd like to bring your iles flottantes 

645
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,960
and pop them behind the photograph of yourself, 

646
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,960
then the judging can commence. 

647
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,960
Mary and Paul are looking for light, perfectly poached meringues, 

648
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,360
silky creme anglaise and, finally, spun sugar. 

649
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,160
They all look quite different. 

650
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,920
And they'll have no idea whose they are judging. 

651
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,480
Just start down here. I don't think it looks very good at all. 

652
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,280
They have lost their shape and they're not ovals. 

653
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,120
The spun sugar has gone down into the custard and made it sweeter. 

654
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,080
It is very glutinous as well. 

655
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,480
(Shocking.) 

656
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,640
Nice spun sugar on the top here. They're a good oval shape. 

657
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,520
Custard looks a good colour. 

658
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,720
That's a good effort, isn't it? 

659
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,600
That meringue is beautiful, it melts in the mouth. 

660
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,240
That meringue itself, that needed more beating until it was shiny. 

661
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,400
I think it needed more sugar-work as well. 

662
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,680
The sauce anglaise is not too bad. It's pretty much there. 

663
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,840
It tastes very nice. 

664
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,560
The spun sugar hasn't really appeared. 

665
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,720
It's got six little pieces of spun sugar on top. 

666
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,800
They've either over or under-whipped this meringue. 

667
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,760
It's burnt, this sugar. See how dark that is? 

668
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,560
The meringue, when you're cutting it, is holding its shape 

669
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,120
and it's a better texture. 

670
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,720
The custard is about right, really. 

671
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,360
They are quite smooth. It's lost a bit of the height, hasn't it? 

672
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,880
- The sauce is all over it. 
- Little bit split. 

673
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,800
It is split. It's a bold meringue, though. It's nice and smooth. 

674
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,160
A different interpretation here of the spun sugar. 

675
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,520
It's not finely spun, but it looks quite attractive. 

676
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,840
The anglaise looks all right, actually. 

677
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,240
- The texture's good.
- Mm-hm. 

678
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,080
The spun sugar's gone down. 

679
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,440
It's a good custard, but the consistency looks just about right. 

680
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,000
- These are huge. 
- They are massive, aren't they? 

681
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,160
- That custard's just a bit too thin.
- Yeah. 

682
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,760
Let's see how the texture is. 

683
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,240
They just needed longer poaching. 

684
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,960
It's not a smooth meringue. 

685
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,760
These are... 

686
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,400
- ..pancakes.
- And these meringues are actually weeping. 

687
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
The volume is coming out of them. 

688
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,240
It's collapsed and it isn't a perfect shape. 

689
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,760
Actually, I don't like the flavour on that one either. 

690
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,040
This one has got a beautifully shaped quenelle. 

691
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,480
Custard...looks all right as well, actually. 

692
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,760
Nice spun sugar on here. 

693
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,680
- Mmm. That's good.
- I like that one. 

694
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,960
Paul and Mary will now rank the iles flottantes 

695
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,920
from worst to best. 

696
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,560
In 11th place... 

697
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,520
- this one here.
- That would be me. 

698
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,040
- You know where you went wrong. 
- I do now. 

699
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,000
In 10th place...is this one. 

700
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
What happened to these huge bombs of meringues? 

701
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,160
- I did use the spoons we were given. 
- Were the spoons this big? 

702
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,400
No, I promise you, I am feeding an army. 

703
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,000
Number nine - sauce a little bit sort of all gluey. 

704
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,760
Frances is eighth, Howard seventh, Kimberley sixth, 

705
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,160
and Ali is ranked fifth. 

706
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,920
- Four is this one.
- Me. 
- The sugar-work I like, actually. 

707
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,000
The taste of that custard was good as well. 

708
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,920
Number three right here. The custard was a little on the thick side, 

709
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,240
but beautiful shapes and the texture was good. 

710
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,600
Number two is this one. 

711
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,480
- That's me. 
- Nice one, Rob. Neat, tidy. 

712
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,080
The custard was nice as well. 

713
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,400
And number one - well done. 

714
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,240
ALL: Well done, Glenn. 

715
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,360
APPLAUSE 

716
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,240
These are a beautiful shape, excellent custard, 

717
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,040
good spun sugar - it can be done. 

718
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,920
I am feeling absolutely fantastic. 

719
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,680
I didn't know, really, what I was doing and I thought 

720
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,200
if I'm bottom or second to bottom, I'll have done well, 

721
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,560
so to come fourth, I'm still stunned. 

722
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,280
I was happy with my spun sugar. 

723
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,800
That's one positive. 

724
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,040
And I wasn't 11th. 

725
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,760
I don't know how to spin sugar, I can't make creme anglaise 

726
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,480
and I've never poached a meringue in my life. 

727
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,280
DUCKS QUACK 

728
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,560
One dessert challenge remaining, 

729
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,400
one more chance to secure a place in the next Bake Off 

730
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,960
and one last opportunity to claim Star Baker. 

731
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,520
It's nice to see Glenn up at the top end. 

732
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,440
He's been sort of mid-range for a while now. 

733
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,680
- He has pulled away slightly. 
- Ruby as well. 

734
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,400
I thought her trifle was excellent, third in the technical. 

735
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,040
Christine, great pina colada trifle as well. 

736
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,760
Such an original idea and it really, really worked, all those flavours. 

737
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,240
- Will you lose one or two bakers today?
- Wait and see. 

738
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:24,040
Oh, that put me in my place! But who do you think is in real danger? 

739
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,320
Definitely, I'm afraid, Mark. His trifle wasn't that good 

740
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,200
and he was last in the technical. 

741
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,640
Beca, because of the disaster with the trifle. 

742
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,720
Deborah, I thought she was lucky to have Howard's custard. 

743
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,560
You know there's a penalty for taking someone's creme anglaise? 

744
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,000
You can be taken into CUSTODY. 

745
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,800
Oh, dear me...I thought... 

746
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,600
THEY LAUGH 

747
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,400
You are a fool. Well done. 

748
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,120
Bakers, today Mary and Paul would love you to 

749
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,800
come up with some petits fours. 

750
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,080
We're actually looking for petit 24, in fact. 

751
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,680
12 biscuit based, 12 sponge based. 

752
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,600
You can do what you like within that. 

753
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,320
You can make them with chocolate, you can add sugar-work, 

754
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,360
whatever you like but they must be bite-sized. 

755
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,640
I know Paul looks like a silverback - 

756
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,360
mouth of a pixie. 

757
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,840
OK, so, you have got three hours in which to do this. 

758
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,720
- On your marks...
- Get set...
- Bake! 

759
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,560
I'm juggling it with a strict order today so that if I do this first, 

760
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,440
then that, then that, and I'm really trying to stick to it. 

761
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,440
I think the secret is keep your basic bake easy. 

762
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,520
Whatever you're going to add to it, whether it be flavours or toppings, 

763
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,760
go to town on that, but make sure your proper bake is perfect. 

764
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,360
There are so many elements to do for both, and time is really tight. 

765
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,120
It's the most difficult challenge yet. 

766
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,880
Lots of different icings, lots of different fillings. 

767
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,400
They've all got to be precise. It's absolutely pushing them. 

768
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,200
It just feels a really frenzied bake, generally. 

769
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,440
Three hours is not a huge amount of time, 

770
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,840
but broken down, it's easy to attain the perfect petit four. 

771
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,440
Everything I have made so far 

772
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,920
has being too big, too deep, too wide, too broad, 

773
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,320
and it's petit four day... 

774
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,320
so I have to make them small! 

775
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,280
Glenn is making bouchees of sea salt, 

776
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,680
caramelised billionaire shortbread, 

777
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,000
and orange financiers topped with kumquat and Italian butter cream. 

778
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,760
I'm cooling my beurre noisette - nutty butter, basically. 

779
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,920
Traditionally, French financiers start with a batter 

780
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,520
made with ground almonds and beurre noisette. 

781
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,080
It's basically butter that you boil a bit 

782
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,920
until the milk solids separate, go the colour of a hazelnut - 

783
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,680
that's what "noisette" means in French - and somehow, 

784
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,960
the butter's nuttiness just really works with the almonds. 

785
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,520
This is the Sachertorte, which is nearly ready to go into the oven. 

786
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,640
It should be quite rich. With a small mouthful, you can take rich 

787
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,960
and beautiful and sickly and all those things. 

788
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,400
Christine's amaretto parcels will be joined by her brandy snap 99-ers, 

789
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,880
filled with raspberries, mascarpone cream and pistachios. 

790
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,080
So, what are you using as a mould? 

791
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,040
I have two little tools here, so when they come out of the oven, 

792
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,040
while they are still soft, they mould round the bottom of the cone 

793
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,560
and make tiny little... 

794
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,360
- Now, what's that? 
- My husband made it for me. 

795
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,400
Your husband made that. 

796
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,000
I said to him I just want a little thing that makes tiny little cones. 

797
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
- I'm actually speechless.
- He should be mentioned in dispatches. 

798
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,960
These are my canaille style chocolate cakes. 

799
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,960
A canaille is a very, very soft cake with a crunchy exterior. 

800
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,440
What's really pretty is you get the fluting which the mould provides. 

801
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,200
Deborah's cake will be topped with crystallised pansies 

802
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,600
and, to continue the floral theme, her biscuits are designed to look 

803
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,720
and taste like tiny red roses. 

804
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,640
SHE GASPS 

805
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,840
Shoot. Sorry, I just burned my hand. 

806
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,080
I have so much stuff to remember at the movement. 

807
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,520
I have to keep an eye on my jam, I got a sponge in the oven, 

808
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,480
I'm whipping some meringue, so it's all a bit intense. 

809
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,760
Ruby's petits fours feature lemon shortbread 

810
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,080
and white chocolate seashells filled with raspberry curd 

811
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,280
and a miniature layered cake, which is a bit of a work in progress. 

812
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,880
Tell us about your cake. 

813
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,000
- It's just chocolate and blackberry cake.
- Yeah. 

814
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So, how are you decorating it? 

815
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,760
Well, I shall see when I come to it. 

816
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,120
You don't know? Are you winging this one? 

817
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,440
I'm winging it a bit, yeah, I am. I can't lie. 

818
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,440
She's had exams, Paul, she's doing a philosophy degree. 

819
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,760
Good luck, Ruby. 

820
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,400
With their first batches in the oven, the bakers multitasking now 

821
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,480
becomes even more complicated. 

822
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,320
Trying to systematically cross stuff off my list. 

823
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,320
They have to ensure their cakes are evenly baked... 

824
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,720
A little bit longer. 

825
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,040
..whilst at the same time perfecting the biscuit dough. 

826
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,400
I'm doing my petits fours inspired by Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker ballet. 

827
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,560
So, I am doing ginger nut crackers and then I'm going to be 

828
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,080
presenting them all on, like, a vinyl record on top of a cake stand 

829
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,760
with, like, the nutcracker ballet bites written in the middle. 

830
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,720
Her ginger nut crackers will be sandwiched with cardamom-flavoured 

831
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,160
white chocolate ganache 

832
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,240
and they will partner sugar-plum fairy cakes topped with 

833
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,160
French meringue butter cream. 

834
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,720
The thing with petits fours is they want each one the same, 

835
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,160
so I'm weighing each one out to about five grams. 

836
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,400
It shouldn't take too long to do this. Famous last words. 

837
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,160
Howard is the only baker making a savoury biscuit. 

838
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,560
The theme running across both his petits fours is designed to 

839
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,360
fit with exactly when they are supposed to be eaten. 

840
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,240
I'm doing two petits fours that are 

841
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,640
based on something you might have at the end of a meal, 

842
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,280
so I'm doing a black coffee one, which is the cake, 

843
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,600
and then I am doing one which is based on cheese and biscuits. 

844
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,160
It's essentially like a cheesy biscuit. 

845
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,400
- Oh, right.
- Almost like a jammy dodger, where 

846
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,440
you've got the quince paste sandwiched with biscuit ether side 

847
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,040
and a little bit of pear on top. 

848
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,480
I think that can work because a quince paste is not wet. 

849
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,920
- No.
- So, the biscuit will stay crisp. 

850
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,560
And white Stilton. It's not like a blue Stilton 

851
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,280
where it brings a strong flavour, 

852
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,680
it's just a quite subtle flavour. 

853
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,240
HE WHISTLES 

854
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,800
Mark's going for something a little sweeter. 

855
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,480
Apart from taste, petits fours are all about presentation. 

856
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,280
I've got to make sure the presentation is bang on. 

857
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,360
He's making rose and pistachio flavoured macaroons to go with 

858
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,760
his chocolate raspberry delights flavoured with raspberry liqueur. 

859
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,800
The macaroons, where are they at the moment. Are they in the fridge? 

860
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,600
- No, I'm just about to lay them out now.
- You haven't piped them yet. 

861
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,120
No, I'm about to. There should be an hour and a quarter left, isn't there? 

862
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,240
- Yes.
- All right.
- How long are you resting them before you bake them? 

863
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,440
- Half an hour.
- Is that long enough? 
- Yes.
- Good lad. 

864
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,640
Bakers, you've got one hour left of petit four fun. 

865
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,440
Paul and Mary will demand absolute uniformity. 

866
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,720
Bomb site at the desk. 

867
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,200
And even if they do manage to bake their cakes evenly... 

868
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,000
They're out. 

869
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,800
..the bakers still face the harder task of ensuring 

870
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,520
their miniature biscuits and macaroons emerge from the oven 

871
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,840
with identical colour and texture. 

872
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,520
These aren't the actual petits fours. These are just for decoration. 

873
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,600
Whoops. 

874
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,120
One more minute. 

875
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,320
Beca's miniature macaroons will top her Limoncello 

876
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,280
and blueberry bursts, and ganache topped millionaire shortbreads will 

877
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,120
be filled with freshly made apricot jam flavoured with amaretto. 

878
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,520
I don't know why I thought this would be a good idea, 

879
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,160
but I'm happy with how they look. 

880
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,880
They look really cute. They've got blueberry jam in the middle. 

881
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,080
So, it's really intense. 

882
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,080
I am just doing as much stuff as I can 

883
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,160
on the smallest cake in the world, basically. That's my plan today. 

884
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,320
Deborah's cakes aren't quite small enough. 

885
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,480
I can't do this... 

886
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,160
I'm actually really worried that I can't get them out. 

887
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,040
I just don't know why I have such difficulty. 

888
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,120
It may be the fluting, I don't know, but last time I made them 

889
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,920
they were OK, but I have a bit of a worry today. 

890
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,320
Oh, they are breaking. 

891
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,280
HE LAUGHS 

892
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,360
Oh, dear. 

893
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,520
The macaroons aren't very good. Either they haven't rested for 

894
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,920
long enough and haven't formed a skin or I haven't mixed them enough. 

895
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,480
What I could do with is a really narrow cutter. 

896
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,360
What kind of cutter? 

897
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,520
You're nicking stuff from Howard's bench again. 

898
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,200
It's your natural port of call, isn't it? Howard watch out! 

899
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,320
You need razor wire here! 

900
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,760
Do you know, I had this down to time? 

901
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,480
I cannot even begin to get my head around it 

902
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,720
- and I am so bloody mad. 
- Have you used these before? 
- About half a dozen times. 

903
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,440
It'll just neaten it off slightly. 

904
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,360
They look beautiful, like little mounds, which is sweet. 

905
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,040
But I've lost my fluting. 

906
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,040
Let's hope they like the biscuits. 

907
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:56,000
You've got 15 minutes left on the old petits fours challenge. 

908
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,280
I'm just getting them so that they hold into their shapes, 

909
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,400
but it's jolly hot. 

910
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,960
I'm making sherbet. 

911
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,760
It's just going to go as a decoration around 

912
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,720
my lemon and blueberry cake. 

913
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,840
So, Mark, this is bodyshop time. You done the panel beating, 

914
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,480
- now it's just a respray and then you're good to go.
- Yeah. 

915
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,880
Are you pleased with them? 

916
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,640
No, I'm not brilliant with small. 

917
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,680
What are you going to do about the macaroons? Or is there no escape? 

918
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,960
There is no escape. Really? 

919
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,680
- There is no disguising the macaroons.
- You can't, can you? 

920
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,600
Well, I been exposed as winging it today, so that's a worry, 

921
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:55,640
so they'll be extra eagle-eyed looking out for shoddy finishing. 

922
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,840
Nasty, messy chocolate...oh, no! 

923
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,400
I need a plate. 

924
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,800
Bakers, that is literally it. Please step away from the petits fours. 

925
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,240
The Challenge is over. 

926
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,080
Paul and Mary will now judge all of the petits fours. 

927
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,160
I got more gold leaf on my fingers 

928
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,320
than I managed to get on any of them... 

929
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:56,160
Gold leaf floating gently away with my chances of being Star Baker. 

930
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,560
I don't get the contrast in sizes between those two at all. 

931
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,960
They are more like truffles than biscuits, really. 

932
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,360
- It's not a brilliant shortbread underneath.
- Right. 

933
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,080
I love it, I love the flavour. 

934
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,280
You couldn't put it on top, the Italian butter cream? Delicious. 

935
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,720
- Thank you. 
- Really, really good. 

936
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,520
My brandy snap cones could be a little soft. 

937
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,520
It was a little bit wet. Well, not wet. 

938
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,520
It just wasn't as firm as it should have been. 

939
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,720
They look tempting. They look different and very tricky to make 

940
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,880
those brandy snaps in a cone. 

941
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,560
Gosh, that's scrummy. 

942
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,800
The crunch is still there, It works. Well thought out. 

943
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,520
They are delicious as well. Good sachertorte. Well baked. 

944
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,800
The ganache is good. Good shine on it as well. 

945
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,160
All I am hearing now in my ears is "Mmm!" 

946
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,000
Something is weird in that tent that just makes it so difficult to bake. 

947
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,600
I know how to do macaroons, but today not so much. 

948
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,880
- Macaroon is not good.
- No. 

949
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,840
You need to rest them for more than 20 minutes, let me put it that way. 

950
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,600
It's a good flavour. I like it, it's just that they look hideous. 

951
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,160
Yes, they look like little brains. 

952
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,560
The cakes are very thick pieces, aren't they? 

953
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,360
The Genoese is very close textured. 

954
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,880
They are just not polished enough. 

955
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,800
As a petit four, if someone gave me that, 

956
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,640
I'd send it back to the kitchen for sure and ask for the chef. 

957
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,040
It is just a shortbread biscuit with a bit of decoration on. 

958
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,200
I would have liked something sharp in it. It's too sweet. 

959
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,120
I think the look of it is too bland. 

960
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,800
You've done very well to keep those crisp all the way through. 

961
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,560
Creamy as well, the flavours are coming through strong. 

962
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:27,360
A very good chocolate cake - it's not improved by the topping. 

963
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,160
They look remarkably professional. 

964
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,640
They're delicious. The texture of that sponge is perfect. 

965
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,880
The macaroons haven't got a shiny top. 

966
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,640
I expected precision because that's what you do. 

967
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:47,080
I've got an awful feeling that having put the thin slices of pear 

968
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,400
on top of the biscuits 

969
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,960
that they look a little bit like onion rings. 

970
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,040
I would have liked a little more white Stilton in there. 

971
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,720
I think you could have done with that blue. 

972
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,760
It's very bitter 

973
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,120
and the actual cake itself is more like a crumb biscuit. 

974
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,520
I think they look absolutely lovely. 

975
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,920
- Thank you, Mary. 
- You've chosen a scene. 

976
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,520
They are bite-size. 

977
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,960
The flavours that you've got going through there are delicious. 

978
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,880
The French butter cream as well is lovely. 

979
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,080
It melts. 

980
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,040
- Ginger nut crackers. 
- They look enchanting! 

981
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,960
I think those are lovely and they complement each other. 

982
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,720
Very good bake. What more could we ask? 

983
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,480
I'm not particularly happy with either of them. 

984
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,800
They actually looked better than they did at home, 

985
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,240
so that's something at least. 

986
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,880
They taste lovely. 

987
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,520
That's a bit of all right. I like it. 

988
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,920
The chocolate works well. 

989
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,520
The raspberry, the shortbread is nice and short. 

990
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,840
I'm not sure about the look of the cake... 

991
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,200
..but it is delicious. 

992
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,040
Winging it is OK. 

993
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,320
I didn't mean to. 

994
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,880
I think you just put something together. And it works 

995
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,560
because the flavours are good and it's been baked well. 

996
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,800
Deborah, please come forward. 

997
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,000
At home I would have screamed, 

998
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,640
thrown them in the bin and started again. 

999
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:24,640
If they don't send me home, I will be gob-smacked. 

1000
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,280
It does look a bit of a mess, if I'm going to be brutally honest. 

1001
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,480
- These cakes...well, you know about those.
- Yes, yes, yes. 

1002
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,920
The biscuits, for me, that is just a little bit bright... 

1003
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,120
They taste of rose. 

1004
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,160
- And that's it.
- OK. 
- That's bone dry... 

1005
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,280
Beautiful flavour. It's lovely with the cherry as well. 

1006
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,360
The flavour of the chocolate is very good, even though it's not even. 

1007
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,280
They are lovely if you don't look at them too closely. 

1008
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,600
Thank you. I'll take my glasses off then. 

1009
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,560
Everything went to plan. Yay! 

1010
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,840
I really like how they look, so now it's down to taste. 

1011
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,120
That's the most frustrating thing, not knowing how it tastes. 

1012
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,160
I don't want to go! 

1013
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,160
They do look very special. 

1014
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,880
How you've made those weenie perfect macaroons - I don't know. 

1015
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,880
They've got a shine on top. Technically perfect. 

1016
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:00,000
Mm, there's a lovely surprise in the middle there. Beautifully lemony. 

1017
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,600
- I like that.
- I love that. 

1018
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,880
- Yay!
- I love that. I love the flavours. 

1019
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,280
Beautiful flavours. Marzipan as well especially works extremely well. 

1020
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,360
And you've got a beautiful shine on the ganache at the top 

1021
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,640
and a pretty decoration. 

1022
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,400
- Perfect, yes. They are very very good.
- Good. 

1023
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,560
I'm sensing it's going to be hard to choose a Star Baker this week. 

1024
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:44,120
You could put Ruby up there. I liked her cake. I loved the flavours. 

1025
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,640
I loved the shortbread with the white chocolate, that raspberry inside there. 

1026
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,880
- It was so good. 
- And she was third in technical. 

1027
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,880
- Who else is up?
- Christine really pushed the boat out with 

1028
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,720
the petits fours. It's so unusual to do those little cornets. 

1029
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,280
It seems to me this challenge was great for Frances as well. 

1030
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,760
One of your criticisms of her has been style over substance. 

1031
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,480
I thought the flavours and the whole presentation, precision. 

1032
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,000
It was all there. Tick tick tick. 

1033
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,200
At the bottom, who would you see being in serious danger 

1034
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,920
following this last Showstopper challenge? 

1035
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,120
I think, initially, Mark. 

1036
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,160
We are looking for finesse and precision. 

1037
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,600
He slipped away badly this week. 

1038
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,600
There were question marks hanging over Beca. 

1039
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,840
Do you think she's done enough to redeem herself? 

1040
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,920
- Oh, yes.
- Those little tiny macaroons on the top. 

1041
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,400
And those macaroons were quite exceptional. 

1042
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,760
Howard didn't do so well, did he? 

1043
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,640
His technical was a bit disappointing. 

1044
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,320
We also had Deborah's custard. 

1045
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:36,360
I think Deborah was certainly capable of doing so much better. 

1046
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,760
So, there seems to be a little cluster of bakers around the bottom. 

1047
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,560
Could it be that we see two leave today? 

1048
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,920
- We will have to decide. 
- If we marry up... 

1049
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,920
Really, that's a whole different show, Paul, but I'm happy. 

1050
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,040
That's the spin-off. 

1051
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:53,000
- We could officiate. This is the most exciting thing that's happened to Bake Off...
- Will you? 

1052
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,840
Unbelievable. 

1053
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,480
But will two be going? 

1054
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,520
- I don't know.
- They never say! 

1055
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,360
Inscrutable, the pair of you. 

1056
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,120
We will leave you two lovebirds to make your decision. 

1057
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,360
I never saw it. Did you? So good at hiding it. 

1058
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,480
The chemistry has always been there. 

1059
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,200
Bakers, I am the lucky one this week. I've got the joyful task 

1060
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,240
of telling you who this week's Star Baker is going to be. 

1061
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,040
Paul and Mary decided that this person's 

1062
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:34,720
incredibly cool, steady hand, with execution, 

1063
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:39,400
with technique and, above all, with absolutely superlative flavours. 

1064
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,560
This week's Star Baker is... 

1065
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,160
..Christine. 

1066
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,360
Well done! 

1067
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,800
APPLAUSE 

1068
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,640
Now, this week I have the slightly onerous task, in fact, 

1069
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,760
incredibly onerous. 

1070
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,600
Every single week we have to lose one person 

1071
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,160
and this week... 

1072
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,880
Paul and Mary have decided... 

1073
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,280
..that two people will be leaving. 

1074
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,000
Oh, my God! 

1075
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,360
The first person who will not be joining us 

1076
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,880
in the tent next week is... 

1077
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,640
..Mark. 

1078
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,240
Fair cop. 

1079
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,800
And the second person is... 

1080
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,840
..Deborah. We will miss you both. 

1081
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,120
Come on. Mel and Sue sandwich - in we go... 

1082
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,960
A bigger filling! 

1083
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,280
Thank you. 

1084
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,840
When you take the three challenges overall, it had to be Deborah. 

1085
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,360
Likewise when you take the three challenges overall, 

1086
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,840
it had to be Mark. 

1087
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:50,920
If he had chosen anyone else I would almost have stood up and said, "No, no." 

1088
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:54,280
I went out to people who were fundamentally better. 

1089
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:59,040
Deborah had huge potential, but she's had a bad two days, really. 

1090
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,800
It kicked off with the wrong custard 

1091
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,480
and I think from that point on it just kind of... 

1092
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,000
Yeah. A cascade of misery! 

1093
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,040
We're going to be separated, love! 

1094
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,520
It's sad. We don't like it to be two, 

1095
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,400
but when you're in a situation like that, when all the others 

1096
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,000
are beginning to pull away, it had to be two people leaving today. 

1097
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,680
- I'm really going to miss you, matey.
- Thank you so much. 

1098
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,040
Great time. I've met some lovely people. 

1099
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,560
Everyone's been so nice... 

1100
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,480
Oh, you're going to do well. 

1101
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,600
'It's just that everybody says that. Don't they? 

1102
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,960
'Because everybody is so nice and I have met some great people 

1103
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,600
'and made some great new friends.' 

1104
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,960
It's been the most fantastic 

1105
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,600
and most stressful thing I have ever done in my life. 

1106
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,960
- Come on.
- Yay! 

1107
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,640
Mam is going to be very proud and so is my husband and my dad. 

1108
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,480
Thank you... 

1109
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,040
Afterwards, Paul came up to me and said you nailed it. Well done. 

1110
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,200
So, hearing that, I'm just bursting. 

1111
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,720
Your husband is going to be so chuffed with you. 

1112
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,360
Just got Star Baker! 

1113
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,520
SHE LAUGHS 

1114
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,800
'Next time...' 

1115
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,720
I think that brown stuff is burned. 

1116
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,880
'It's pies.' 

1117
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,000
'The terror of a soggy bottom has been keeping me up all night.' 

1118
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,120
'And tarts.' 

1119
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,920
Definitely not my weekend. 

1120
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,280
'With signature double-crusted fruit pies...' 

1121
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,160
Sounds like it needs planning permission. 

1122
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,320
'Technical custard tart perfection...' 

1123
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,920
This is going to be a problem. 

1124
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,600
'..and Showstopping filo pastry pies.' 

1125
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,200
Is anybody up there, the god of crisp? 

1126
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,440
'But who will be heading for stardom?' 

1127
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,800
That's all right. 

1128
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,680
'And who will be heading home?' 

1129
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,480
- Hang on, hang on.
- Oh, dear.
- Hang on. 

1130
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,520
(I can't watch this.) 

1131
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,080
- Slowly.
- We're in there.
- Easy. 

1132
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,960
- Are we going to the plate? 
- Easy now.
- To the plate!
- Easy! 

1133
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,680
