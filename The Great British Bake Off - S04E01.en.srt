1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,040
So the wait is over and the weight is very much about to go on. 

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,880
Put your pinnies on, grease those tins, 

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,040
put on your comfortable baking mules 

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,680
in honour of a batch of brand-new home bakers. 

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,640
Mary Berry's been sharpening her knives 

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,360
and Paul Hollywood has very much been sharpening his hair quiff 

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,200
with the aid of some Cow Gum and whale grease 

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,680
and they're about to be unleashed on this baker's dozen. 

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,800
That's right, for 2013 we've got 13 new bakers, 

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,800
but only one will emerge from this tent victorious. 

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,040
Welcome to The Great British Bake Off. 

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,680
This year, over 10,000 people applied, 

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,640
hoping to reach the Bake Off tent. 

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,920
It's a bit like waking up on Christmas Day, sort of excitement, 

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,320
and then coupled with potentially that I was going to have to do an exam. 

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,640
And now 13 of the best home bakers from across the country 

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,840
have finally made it. 

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,160
I hope I just don't get too fazed by things 

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,240
and remember that this is something 

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,120
that I do literally every day at home. 

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,760
Over the next ten weeks, 

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,760
all of their baking skills will be put to the test. 

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,360
I don't want to be the guy that everyone is screaming at 

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,040
on the telly, "Why on earth did you do that?!" 

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,840
And this year's judges, Paul and Mary... 

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,440
Four hours to do this is enough. 

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,960
..are taking the Bake Off... 

28
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,840
Yes, I'm not very organised at this point. 

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,880
..to a whole new level. 

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,480
Oh, that looks so good. 

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,160
It would be good if I could say that I wasn't scared of Paul, 

32
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,920
but that wouldn't really be the truth. 

33
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,360
I'm more nervous about Mary, actually. 

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,800
Every week, they'll set three brand-new challenges... 

35
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,320
Right, game on. 

36
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,720
..designed to reveal who has the natural baking instinct... 

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,640
I don't know to what extent one should whisk them. 

38
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,040
..and burning passion. 

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,320
Wanting to pull out all the stops. Or squirrels in my case. 

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,360
..to produce stunning cakes, breads, biscuits and desserts. 

41
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,440
- I'm behind.
- Yep. 

42
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,920
- Stressed.
- Yep. 

43
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,280
Slightly doolally. 

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,120
These are optimal conditions for Bake Off. 

45
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,600
Those who fall short will have to leave. 

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,800
It will be a tragedy if his head falls off. 

47
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,880
Those who excel... 

48
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,400
Success! Ha-ha! 

49
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,280
..will be named star baker... 

50
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,000
HE WHISPERS 

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,720
..but who will make it through... 

52
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,840
If my bottom is dry today, all will be right with the world. 

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,200
..and be crowned the winner... 

54
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,160
Don't be sad. You've got such a long way to go. 

55
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,880
'..of The Great British Bake Off?' 

56
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,040
We have ignition. 

57
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,120
Please don't break, please don't break, please don't break. 

58
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,840
We're back at Harptree Court in Somerset. 

59
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,920
This year's Bake Off is bigger than ever, and so are we. 

60
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,600
- I used a surgical truss.
- Oh! 
- Just a much bigger bandage, 

61
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,720
you can actually screw it tighter each week. 

62
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,800
- You don't lace? 
- Do you lace? 

63
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,640
You get top and undergut, I find, with lace. 

64
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,720
Yes, that's true. 

65
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,920
It's cake week. 

66
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,000
For the back boobs, I sellotape... 

67
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,120
Baker's dozen, welcome to the Bake Off tent. 

68
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,040
You might have noticed that there are 13 of you, 

69
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,120
which is lovely, the more, the merrier. Very cosy. 

70
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,160
But I'm afraid it does mean that at any point, 

71
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,960
Mary and Paul might well say goodbye to two of you. 

72
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,520
Could be this weekend, it could be in the semifinal. 

73
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,000
Now it is time for your first ever Signature Challenge. 

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,720
So, what Mary and Paul are looking for is a twist on a British classic. 

75
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,640
A sandwich cake. Now, the filling of your sandwich could be anything 

76
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,320
from lemon drizzle, coffee and walnut, ham, 

77
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,640
to a classic Victoria. 

78
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,120
You've got two hours to bake and decorate and serve your cakes and... 

79
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,880
Mel, if you'd like to dust down that catch phrase. 

80
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,080
For the first time. On your marks. 

81
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,320
- Get set.
- BOTH: Bake! 

82
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,160
It's incredibly surreal to actually be in the tent, 

83
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,680
but it's surreal in a good way. 

84
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,960
I just need to figure out what I'm doing. 

85
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,400
It's exciting. Yeah, it's exciting, actually. 

86
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,920
It's bigger than I imagined. 

87
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,000
Where's my thingy? 

88
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,960
Ah. 

89
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,960
Not at all calm! 

90
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,560
This year, Paul and Mary have deliberately set 

91
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,600
what seems to be a straightforward first challenge. 

92
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,800
A sandwich cake is a great indicator to let Mary and I know 

93
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,560
what level these bakers are at. 

94
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,680
Because they've got nowhere to hide, if they burn it, if they sink it, 

95
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,400
if they don't weigh it up correctly, 

96
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
they're in serious trouble from the offset. 

97
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,080
I'm more worried about the time than anything else. 

98
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,200
I don't know where my timer is. 

99
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,520
It is easy to make a basic sandwich cake, 

100
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,000
but we want them to go much further than that. 

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,200
I don't want just to see a Victoria sandwich 

102
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,960
filled with strawberry jam and cream. 

103
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,520
I want to see something different. 

104
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,600
Classic Victoria sandwich. 

105
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,440
I think Mary will love the classic nature of it. 

106
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,080
Amy, did you miss your last lesson? 

107
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,000
Glenn is an English teacher and head of sixth form. 

108
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,880
He lives in Exeter with his husband Rob and springer spaniel Molly. 

109
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,600
Molly. Where's the Bake Off. Where's the Bake Off? 

110
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,720
Find the Bake Off. 

111
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,320
His strawberries and cream Victoria sandwich 

112
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,640
is the first cake he ever learned to bake. 

113
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,160
The strawberries, they're left whole so you get big fat chunks 

114
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,840
and normally people like it. 

115
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,440
But then, the people who eat my cakes 

116
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,160
aren't normally professionals, or judges, or professional judges. 

117
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,640
So, cardamom sponge. I went to India last year. 

118
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,320
I think that would have been fresh cardamom there. 

119
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,840
I had cardamom in lots of different food. 

120
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,160
It's got a nice citrus, camphory flavour. 

121
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,480
Grimsby-born Lucy is a former primary school teacher 

122
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,720
who now works as a gardener. Her cardamom sandwich cake 

123
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,880
will be filled with rhubarb from her own back yard. 

124
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,120
It's a great tip to cook it in the oven, 

125
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,800
because so often when you cook that lovely pink early rhubarb... 

126
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,720
- Yes.
- ..it just spreads into a big mess. 

127
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,680
I packed it quite tightly in the pan 

128
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,280
because I wanted it to hold its shape, 

129
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,520
and I don't want every piece to be completely solid 

130
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,160
- so when I put it in I will... 
- Loose. Loose. 

131
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,480
..loosen some of it up a little bit. 

132
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,680
Some people have got a lot of ingredients on their bench, 

133
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,760
and I've kept mine quite simple. 

134
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,760
Beca lives with husband Matthew and daughter Mari 

135
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,640
on an army base, where she sings in the Military Wives' Choir. 

136
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,400
Her grapefruit drizzle sandwich 

137
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,080
is a favourite of the Royal Medical Corps. 

138
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,200
It's interesting that you're using grapefruit, 

139
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,600
because inherently it's quite a sour flavour. Why grapefruit? 

140
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,280
I just thought this would be a little bit more refreshing. 

141
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,680
My husband hates grapefruits, but he really likes this. 

142
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,240
Most of the bakers are making a classic sponge mix with butter, 

143
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,560
sugar, eggs and wheat flour. 

144
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,600
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. 

145
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
- We're going to be fine.
- It's fine. 

146
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,880
It's all fine. 

147
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,360
But one baker is taking an early gamble 

148
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,120
with an unconventional list of basic ingredients. 

149
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,200
It's made with rice flour rather than standard flour. 

150
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,280
And I've put xanthan gum in there. It's a thickening agent. 

151
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,720
You use it basically to give more of a cakey feel to the cake, 

152
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,120
because of the absence of gluten, really. 

153
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,320
Howard is a council worker and lives in Sheffield. 

154
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,000
He spends hours making intricate cakes 

155
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,440
for family birthdays and anniversaries. 

156
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,600
His gluten-free signature bake also contains the juice 

157
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,680
from freshly sliced passion fruit. 

158
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,760
It might be a little bit low impact, 

159
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,600
but what I'm hoping is the taste is really good. 

160
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,320
I'm doing, er... I've forgotten what I'm doing. 

161
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,160
I'm making cake, I think. 

162
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,200
Lemon and poppy seed cake. Thanks to my sister, this one. 

163
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,560
It comes out really nicely, 

164
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,960
as long as I don't put too much lemon in, which I've done before. 

165
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,120
Mark lives in Milton Keynes and works as a kitchen fitter. 

166
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,720
His three boys are already starting to pick up 

167
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,720
their dad's flair for baking. 

168
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,000
- What are you doing?
- Me? 

169
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,400
He'll be leaning on his carpentry skills 

170
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,320
to carve his sandwich cake into the shape of a lemon. 

171
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,520
How are you going to do that? 

172
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,840
I'll just cut it with a knife. 

173
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,120
Assuming it all goes well, it'll look like a lemon. 

174
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,280
Good luck, Mark. I hope you don't look like a lemon. 

175
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,840
- I hope your cake does. 
- I hope I don't! 

176
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,040
- Good luck, mate.
- Thank you. 

177
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,280
Mark's not the only one shaping his sandwich cake. 

178
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,240
Frances is taking the challenge quite literally. 

179
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,880
I'm putting it in sandwich moulds, so it's going to be sliced up 

180
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,760
like a giant sort of jam sandwich, Victoria sponge. 

181
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,800
Frances lives in Market Harborough in Leicestershire 

182
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
and works for a children's clothing company, 

183
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,600
designing outfits for toddlers. 

184
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,080
Her giant jam sandwich cake will be served 

185
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,920
in a paper bag made from sugar paste. 

186
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,440
You're creating a paper bag? 

187
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,960
It's the icing on the cake, Sue, the icing on the cake. 

188
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,240
You are too cool for school. 

189
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,040
I like to make cakes humorous and fun. 

190
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,480
- But if the actual cake isn't right...
- Yeah. Not good. 

191
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,200
..the silverback will be angry. 

192
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,720
He'll be out there. 

193
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,960
Bakers, you've got one hour left. 

194
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,880
You are halfway through your sandwich. 

195
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,520
- Stop it, you're making that up! 
- I'm not making it up, Mark. 

196
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,840
I'm a little behind schedule. 

197
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,840
I hadn't realised quite how restricting it is 

198
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,240
working on these surfaces. 

199
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,080
You get used to all the surfaces at home. 

200
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,280
Paul and Mary are looking for two identical sponges. 

201
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,480
OK, this is going to be a bit of a balancing act. 

202
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,840
The amount of batter needs to be exactly the same in each tin. 

203
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,120
550, and... 

204
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,760
- 700.
- It's looking correct at the moment. 

205
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,120
So if I take out 75... 

206
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,120
That should work, shouldn't it? 

207
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,480
This is why I don't teach maths. 

208
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,720
I've levelled off the sponges and they're ready to go in. 

209
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,400
To ensure that they're baked identically, 

210
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,600
the sponges should both be on the same oven shelf. 

211
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,240
If not, one sponge may cook faster than the other, 

212
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,320
producing a dry top... 

213
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,880
Lovely. 

214
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,520
..and an underdone base. 

215
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,760
Done. 

216
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,400
But perfect sponges are just the beginning. 

217
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,920
The sandwich cake's fillings should also be faultless. 

218
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,800
I got a little overexcited. I underestimated the power, 

219
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,520
and now there's more icing sugar outside of the bowl 

220
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,120
than there is inside of the bowl. 

221
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,920
My mum doesn't like me baking at home, 

222
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,880
cos when I'm finished it's like a bomb went off in the kitchen. 

223
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,080
Ali is a charity worker and lives with his mum and dad, 

224
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,560
three brothers and younger sister in Birmingham. 

225
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,000
He's the only man in his family who's ever baked. 

226
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,760
We expect a dessert on a daily basis now. 

227
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,760
His pistachio sandwich cake 

228
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,840
will be filled with lychee and rose butter cream. 

229
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,080
These flavours appear a lot 

230
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,520
in the desserts that we have in Pakistan. 

231
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,320
But it's a dangerous flavour. I'm always wary when using rose, 

232
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,240
because you always have that fear of a pot pourri sort of taste, 

233
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,760
so I'm trying to be quite subtle but distinct at the same time. 

234
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,280
The battle to impress in this year's first signature bake... 

235
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,560
Oh, gosh! 

236
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,720
..is beginning to get a little bloody. 

237
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,040
I think that was rhubarb. That may have been a vanilla pod. 

238
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,000
I know one of them was an orange. 

239
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,200
- I do worry.
- Don't worry. 

240
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,440
I want you to have at least three on each hand, otherwise I panic. 

241
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,240
- I've got at least four on that one, so I'm OK.
- Good. Keep it that way. 

242
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,320
Christine lives in Didcot, Oxfordshire, with her husband Rob. 

243
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,720
She aims to pass on to her grandchildren all the baking secrets 

244
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,680
her grandmother taught her over 60 years ago. 

245
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,280
Her strawberry and vanilla sandwich cake is all about the decoration. 

246
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,480
I'm going to make it into a summer basket 

247
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,560
and then I'm going to pipe basket work all around the edge, 

248
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,120
strawberries on the top. 

249
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,280
I like the idea, but it's a timing issue as well. 

250
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,080
No, it's OK with time, I can pipe quite quickly. 

251
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,480
Like Christine, Ruby is already a finger down. 

252
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,400
I'm making a rhubarb and custard cake, 

253
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,040
just because I really like rhubarb and I was like, 

254
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,840
I need to fit it into one recipe so I'll get over and done with 

255
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,480
while I can before I get kicked out. 

256
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,080
Essex-born Ruby is this year's youngest baker. 

257
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,200
She's currently studying for a degree 

258
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,080
in history of art and philosophy. 

259
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,920
Her sandwich cake has been inspired 

260
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,440
by childhood memories of her favourite boiled sweet. 

261
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,520
- I'm going to make a creme patissiere for in the middle.
- Oh, lovely, OK. 

262
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,360
Are you having anything else in the middle 

263
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,960
other than your creme patissiere? 

264
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,400
The rhubarb jam as well. I'm candying some rhubarb as well. 

265
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,960
I'm going to dip it in sugar syrup and then put it in a low oven. 

266
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,200
Crystallised rhubarb, now I've never heard of that. 

267
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,720
- That's something new for us. 
- Hopefully it'll be all right. 

268
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,400
- Ruby's rhubarb.
- Yes, Ruby's rhubarb. 

269
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,720
- Good luck on that one, then, Ruby. 
- Thank you. Thanks. 

270
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,400
- Looking forward to it. 
- See you in a bit. 

271
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,840
Are you hailing a cab, Howard? What's going on? 

272
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,040
I cut my thumb on a sharp knife. 

273
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,520
You're not the only one. Lucy's done it, Ruby, Christina. 

274
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,840
It's basically like a sort of hybrid reality show now. 

275
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,200
It's Bake Off meets Casualty. 

276
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,120
I'm going to sit here in solidarity with you. 

277
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,800
HE LAUGHS 

278
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,320
45 minutes to go in the Signature Challenge. 

279
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,040
They should be ready now. 

280
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,960
I think they're actually there. I think I'm fussing now. 

281
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,560
That's done. 

282
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,360
Bouncy. 

283
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,280
Whoa! 

284
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,520
What...? 

285
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,200
That is not cooking. 

286
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,320
No, no, no, no! 

287
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,000
No, no, no. 

288
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,480
Yes. Mark forgot to check that his oven had preheated 

289
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,720
to the correct temperature before he put his sponges in. 

290
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,920
It's not cooking. It's been in for half an hour and it's not cooking. 

291
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,200
- Have you got it on the right temperature, Mark?
- Yes. 

292
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,400
- You've got it on fan? Everything is as it should be?
- Yes, yes. 

293
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,600
- Then why is it doing that? 
- I don't know... 

294
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,360
Oh, dear. How long have we got left? 

295
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,920
OK, bakers, that's 30 minutes. 30 minutes remaining. 

296
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,560
Aaargh! 

297
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,440
HE LAUGHS 

298
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,080
I was going to cut it into the shape of a lemon, 

299
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,440
but it turns out I'm cutting off 

300
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,680
the only bit of the cake that actually cooked. 

301
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,000
Oh, God. That is awful. 

302
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,560
Oh, God. 

303
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,080
Mark's not the only baker with problems. 

304
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,680
Ruby's creme patissiere has curdled. 

305
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,240
(Don't worry about it.) 

306
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,880
(It's just pressure. Don't worry about it.) 

307
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,520
Don't be sad. You've got such a long way to go. 

308
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,040
Why am I so stupid? 

309
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,440
You're not stupid, it's just pressure. 

310
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,000
Baker's dozen, you've got five minutes left 

311
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,680
on your signature sandwich. 

312
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,320
OK. You've got time, it's all right. Just breathe. Breathe. 

313
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,640
Oh, no, the cakes aren't cold enough. 

314
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,000
This is so bad. 

315
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,600
Oh, God. 

316
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,640
Oh, my god. I can't do it. Look. 

317
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,920
Should I top it with cream? Or should I not? 

318
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,920
I won't, I won't, I won't. It'll be too much cream. 

319
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,800
Come on. Whack it on. 

320
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,000
- Please, please, please...
- You'll feel a lot better when that's on. 

321
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,640
Bakers, your Signature Challenge is over. That's it. 

322
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,120
Done! 

323
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,440
Please move away from those sandwiches. 

324
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,920
The bakers are about to face 

325
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,480
the judgment of Paul and Mary for the first time. 

326
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,880
- Hiya.
- Hello. 

327
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,520
That's massive. 

328
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,920
I think it looks a bit awkward. 

329
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,720
I think it needs to be slightly smaller. 

330
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,880
The strawberries have had a cut base 

331
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,400
and the moisture has run into the actual cake. 

332
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,160
I like it. The strawberry jam hasn't quite set, 

333
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,600
but if that wasn't in there, I wouldn't like it. 

334
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,560
I would have just had the jam and the cream 

335
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,640
and that would have brought the size down. 

336
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,600
You've got a nice even bake of the cake. 

337
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,080
The proportion of icing and topping is right. 

338
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,960
Annoyingly, I really like it. And I'll tell you why. 

339
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,920
Oh, how painful to give a compliment(!) 

340
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,400
Oh, that hurts on such a deep genetic level. 

341
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,520
I wasn't expecting that. 

342
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,520
You're left with that beautiful refreshing flavour in your mouth... 

343
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,600
- Good. Perfect. 
- I've never had that before. 

344
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,040
- It's really good.
- Well done. 

345
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,400
This looks very neat. 

346
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,680
- Thank you. 
- Good flavour. Quite different.
- OK. 

347
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,600
There's so many things going on, blending together to come up with 

348
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,400
something that you think, "Actually, I quite like that." 

349
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,360
The pineapple flavour is coming through. 

350
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,120
I could have even have done with a little bit more pineapple. 

351
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,960
That's packed. 

352
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,960
I like that. There's so much interest in there. 

353
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,360
You keep coming across different things. 

354
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,040
I ran out of time at the end 

355
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,680
just to finish the piping. 

356
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,840
- I did say.
- You did say. 

357
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,800
Timing issue, doing something like this. 

358
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,920
It tastes a lot better 

359
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,120
than it looks! 

360
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,040
SHE LAUGHS 

361
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,080
Thanks(!) 

362
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,000
The idea is you rip the bag off? 

363
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,440
You basically, yes, rip open the bag. 

364
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,560
I love the idea. So if I just cut it into... 

365
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,600
- I reckon triangles.
- Lovely. Lovely. she's obsessed with triangles. 

366
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,160
So you want me to go across that way? 

367
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,320
Well, if you're going to eat it like a sandwich... 

368
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,080
- You've made your jam, haven't you? 
- I did. It's raspberry and rose. 

369
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,760
Lovely texture. 

370
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,280
I think the rose is a little bit too strong, 

371
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,600
but I think the idea's exceptional. 

372
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,400
The rose flavour is coming through quite strongly 

373
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,040
and actually, I like that. 

374
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,280
He's going to say it's too strong for him, I bet. 

375
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,720
I love it. I think you made a really nice cake. 

376
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,160
It looks like a rough plasterer's job. 

377
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,240
Yes. It was supposed to be shaped like a lemon. 

378
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,320
We can see there's bits underbaked. 

379
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,040
The sponge tastes good. The rhubarb has that tang at the end. 

380
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,360
- The cardamom's nice. 
- I like the cardamom. 

381
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,400
It's not overwhelming. It can be a killer, 

382
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,160
but I think overall it's a nice cake. 

383
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,240
It does look a little bit untidy on the top, 

384
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,200
but you've got a very good sponge. 

385
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,400
The creme patissiere is awful. 

386
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,160
It's not quite thick enough. 

387
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,760
You see how the rhubarb and the custard have mixed together, 

388
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,160
more like a fool, but the actual sponge is very good. 

389
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,800
So in between doing that, 

390
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,280
did you manage to go like that and make a sponge? 

391
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,600
I have, but as you can see, it was a little bit late 

392
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,480
going into the oven, which meant it didn't cool down in time, 

393
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,880
and so therefore the butter cream filling 

394
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,760
has seeped rather unelegantly. 

395
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,200
You've got a lovely rise from it. 

396
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,280
Can you tell us about the flour that you used? 

397
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,600
Yes, it's a rice flour, 

398
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,000
and it's got passion fruit within the cake itself. 

399
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,920
That's spot-on. That's a very good cake. 

400
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,760
I think you've ticked all the boxes 

401
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,080
on something that's actually quite difficult to do. 

402
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,440
I thought it was going to be a bit of a close texture, 

403
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,320
but it isn't, it's absolutely lovely. Perfect. 

404
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,400
Next week, should you get there, no knives! 

405
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,800
All right, thanks. 

406
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,000
Thumbs up! 

407
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,400
I think managing to get the cake out there was a bit of a feat 

408
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,520
in itself, but that they actually liked it just amazed me. 

409
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,600
He said, "Annoyingly, I really like it," 

410
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,760
and it's just the way he phrased it that made my heart 

411
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,520
go...! And then it's like - ah, thank God for that! 

412
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,440
I can make a custard, I've made a custard time and time 

413
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,600
and time again, and it's not curdled before. 

414
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,600
They didn't like it a lot, to be fair. It was too big. 

415
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,480
A cake too big, is that possible? 

416
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,600
I'm in shock. I was certain they wouldn't like it. 

417
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,520
I was certain. 

418
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,280
At the risk of sparking a barrage of angry letters from biologists - 

419
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,600
boy, can those guys kick off - 

420
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,840
when it comes to baking, the heart truly is connected to the stomach. 

421
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,560
Making the perfect cake requires devotion, passion 

422
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,200
and lashings of love - all essential ingredients 

423
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,880
when it comes to one particular Lancashire tradition. 

424
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,440
The industrial revolution brought work for men and women, 

425
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,600
but rarely in the same place. 

426
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,640
Generally, men were employed in heavy industry 

427
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,240
whilst women were more likely to work in mills and factories. 

428
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,880
This industrial segregation meant it was very difficult for 

429
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,360
young people to meet each other during the weekdays 

430
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,800
so, at weekends, a new tradition called promenading was born. 

431
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,920
Specific streets in Lancashire towns became known for promenading 

432
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,240
and were given nicknames like the monkey rank and the bunny run 

433
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,960
and the tradition lasted right up until the 1940s. 

434
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,880
Promenading was a courtship ritual. 

435
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,600
It involved young people in their teens, 

436
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,600
wandering up and down the street usually on a Sunday evening, 

437
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,440
there were no clubs to go to in those days. 

438
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,160
And there'd be a lot of cat calling, a lot of larking about, 

439
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,320
a lot of trying to snatch at a girl's hair as they went by. 

440
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,800
So, everything was done on the move. 

441
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,800
- It was. It was a very kind of mobile...
- Walking, grabbing... 

442
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,640
Eyeing each other up waiting to see if they were going to click. 

443
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,400
So, basically, it was like a sea of hormones divided by some cobbles. 

444
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,360
There were kind of boundaries around what went on there. 

445
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,880
You would only take a boyfriend or a girlfriend home 

446
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,600
when you were quite sure that it was likely to end in an engagement. 

447
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,080
And when love finally blossomed in the terraces and 

448
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,480
cobbled streets, there would be one sure-fire way 

449
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,680
for a Lancashire lass to show her affection. 

450
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,120
She'd bake a courting cake! 

451
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,600
There was a basic recipe for a courting cake, 

452
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,240
but the rest was up to the young fiancee. 

453
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,640
So, apart from a lot of leaking pheromones, 

454
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,120
what went into a courting cake? 

455
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,960
Well, a courting cake was a chance to show off a girl's skills, 

456
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,800
so you'd have a shortbread base, double cream from the local farm. 

457
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,360
If it was a special occasion, to use fresh strawberries - 

458
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,680
it was an expensive thing to make for your betrothed - 

459
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,040
and then a traditional Victoria sponge on the top, 

460
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,760
so it's showing off her biscuit skills and her sponge skills. 

461
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,160
So, quite scary for a young girl. 

462
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,800
She's putting her future romance on the line when she bakes. 

463
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,560
She's got to make a good job otherwise her potential husband 

464
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,400
- could be like...
- Forget this! Yes. 

465
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,040
So, how do you put this cake together? 

466
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,200
Does the amount of cream say anything about me? 

467
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,920
I think the more flourish there was, 

468
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,360
the amount of cream and strawberries you put on the top, 

469
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,880
it was something to show your love. 

470
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,760
I think what this is saying to my beloved is 

471
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,800
I'd make a really good plasterer. 

472
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,080
The courting cake has made a bit of a revival recently, 

473
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,640
because when William and Kate came up to their last 

474
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,840
prenuptial engagement, they were presented with 

475
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,400
a courting cake by a local charity. 

476
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,880
It sort of revived the interest 

477
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,520
and the history of the courting cake in Lancashire. 

478
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,320
- The spirit of romance is alive and well in Lancashire.
- That's right. 

479
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,760
That is beautiful. It puts my teenage years in Croydon to shame. 

480
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,640
It certainly beats sitting in a car park drinking cider. 

481
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,560
The bakers were able to practise and plan their first bake of the series. 

482
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,280
Their second is a complete mystery. 

483
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,920
Bakers, it's time for your first technical challenge. 

484
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,160
Let's have a quick communal shoulder roll. De-stress. 

485
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,840
And we're asking you to make a shoulder roll today! 

486
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,720
Mary and Paul are not going to be around to be part of the action, 

487
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,680
- so if you'd like to...?
- Jog on. 

488
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,240
So, your first technical challenge is devilishly difficult. 

489
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,120
Beelzebub's last stand - it's an angel food cake, 

490
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,080
this is a delicate light sponge, topped with 

491
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,520
whipped cream and drizzled with a lemon and passion fruit curd. 

492
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,080
I can tell you that it is one of Mary Berry's very own recipes. 

493
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,400
You've got two and a half hours to make the angels sing. 

494
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,320
- On your marks. 
- Get set.
- BOTH:
- Bake! 

495
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,880
All the bakers have been given the same ingredients. 

496
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,280
What is going on? 

497
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,440
And the same basic recipe to follow. 

498
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,280
I've never seen an angel food cake. 

499
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,840
I've never made it, but I know what it looks like. 

500
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,160
Angel food cake contains no fat, producing a sponge 

501
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,320
so light and fluffy it's said to be fit for angels. 

502
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,600
My target is not to be 13th. 12th, it'll do. 

503
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,440
This is my perfect angel food cake. Perfect. Nice and tall. 

504
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,960
Absolutely even all over the top. Beautifully light, evenly baked. 

505
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,800
It's all right that, Mary. It's got the texture of a marshmallow, 

506
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,200
but it melts in the mouth. 

507
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,600
They should know how to do it, 

508
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,040
but there are one or two points that they can go really wrong on. 

509
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,040
Oh, you're cruel, Mary. 

510
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,200
I know a little bit of the theory about it but just... 

511
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,560
How many eggs have I done? 

512
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,920
Egg whites are the cake's only raising agent. 

513
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,240
I don't know to what extent one should whisk them. 

514
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,120
The air trapped in the egg whites will expand in the oven, 

515
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,560
creating lift. 

516
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,960
I'm definitely thinking a bit more. 

517
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,920
But Mary's recipe doesn't state if they should be soft... 

518
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,240
Oh! 

519
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,520
..or stiff peaked. 

520
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,560
A tense moment. 

521
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,160
Give it a bit more go. 

522
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,800
Rob lives and works in Hertfordshire where he designs space satellites. 

523
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,320
He approaches his baking with similar precision. 

524
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,200
Starting to sound a little thicker, 

525
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,200
but I've done cakes using similar techniques before, 

526
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,040
so I'm not totally lost here. 

527
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,640
I should be saying a little prayer around this bowl, 

528
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,280
considering it's an angel cake. 

529
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,000
Next, sugar should be added to the egg whites... 

530
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,800
Sugar! 

531
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,080
..before carefully folding the flour into the mixture. 

532
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,680
I haven't got time. 

533
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,800
The lumpy bits will be the thing that could bring it down. 

534
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,520
I don't know whether to sift the flour in or whether to mix 

535
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,440
some of this with that and then fold through the rest. 

536
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,160
You spend a lot of time getting air into the egg whites 

537
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,000
and then you have to not get rid of it. 

538
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,960
I think I'll just sift it in gradually. Will I? 

539
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,960
I'm not sure. 

540
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,280
I'm going to do it this way round and put this into there. 

541
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,560
The easiest task becomes like a minefield of difficulties 

542
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,440
on the technical challenge. 

543
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,560
I think it's about confident but delicate folding 

544
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,760
and not overworking. 

545
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,360
It's looking fine. Quite pleased with it. 

546
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,200
I'm massacring it. 

547
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,640
I'm just...I've got all the air out of it somehow. 

548
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,160
I'm going to have to start again. 

549
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,480
How much time have I used? 

550
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,840
90 minutes remaining. 

551
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,840
I'm just wondering whether I ought to grease the tin. 

552
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,400
In order to rise, the fatless sponge mix must be able to grip 

553
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,720
the sides of a cake tin. 

554
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,040
I'm just making sure that the butter is high enough 

555
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,480
up the side of the tin, so that it doesn't stick. 

556
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,320
I'm wondering whether to grease it or not, because it doesn't say 

557
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,080
to grease the tin. I'm thinking it's a sponge cake you need to grease it. 

558
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,040
I'm not sure if I'm meant to be buttering and sugaring the dish. 

559
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,760
Toby's a self-employed web designer whose mum started to teach him 

560
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,400
to bake when he was just eight years old. 

561
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,720
She passed away five years ago and now Toby lives in Reading 

562
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,400
with his dad, John, who gets first taste of everything he creates. 

563
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,080
Well, that shouldn't be any problem. 

564
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,680
I'm not feeling confident. 

565
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,600
This might be my "You stupid idiot!" moment. 

566
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,000
I'm going to go for it. 

567
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,360
I'm going to gently spoon it rather than a great big blob. 

568
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,240
Rise my baby, rise. 

569
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,240
BIRDSONG 

570
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm not sure if it's sunk or whether that's how it's naturally goes. 

571
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,640
I might have slammed the oven door. 

572
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,000
Do I take it out? No, I'll give it another two minutes. 

573
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,960
OK. It's risen. 

574
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,200
It's cracking, physically cracking - not as in it's good! 

575
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,160
OK. I've just heard word from Gabriel. 

576
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,520
I have a direct line up there. 

577
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,400
You've got 30 minutes to deliver that angel food cake 

578
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,480
otherwise they'll be furious. 

579
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,240
I can go with that. 

580
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,240
Because angel food cake is so light, 

581
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,280
the way it's left to cool is unconventional. 

582
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,160
Now it's going to go upside down which feels weird... 

583
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,680
very weird. 

584
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,800
If it's left the right way up, gravity will force it to collapse. 

585
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,440
Either I've got it wrong or everybody else has got it wrong. 

586
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,760
- Right.
- Because it says, leave to cool upside-down. 

587
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,440
- To me this is upside-down. 
- Which way did you put it in the oven? 

588
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,720
It went in the oven this way, so this is upside down 

589
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,080
and I will turn it the right way up to serve it. 

590
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,640
I can't believe I feel this panicked. 

591
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,880
I have a much more stressful job than cake making. 

592
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,360
Married mum of one Deborah lives and works in Peterborough where 

593
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,760
she's a dentist for people with special needs. 

594
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,800
She first discovered her love of baking 

595
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,000
during domestic science lessons at school. 

596
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,480
Are you preparing to flip? 

597
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,200
- Personally or just the cake? 
- Well, yes...! 

598
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,400
- I flipped years ago, so I'm not the person to ask.
- OK. 

599
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,400
- I'm just going to leave it like that.
- OK. 

600
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,720
That's what the legs are for. 

601
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,120
EGG TIMERS BEEP IN BACKGROUND 

602
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,640
- Just leave it like that. 
- Yes. The gravity will bring it down. 

603
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,680
As the cakes cool, Mary's recipe requires the bakers 

604
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,440
to make fresh lemon and passion fruit curd - 

605
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,640
from scratch. 

606
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,160
I don't know whether to do it in a pan or in a bowl. 

607
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,400
What's everyone else doing? 

608
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,760
- You and I will be here tomorrow. 
- Two and a half days later, 

609
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,440
Lucy and Fran are still making their lemon curd! 

610
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,280
The instructions say to make it in a pan, 

611
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,080
but I always do it in a glass bowl on top of some boiling water. 

612
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,560
I just feel like I can control the heat better... 

613
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,320
and I just jinxed myself. 

614
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,440
That just about where I want it. 

615
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,840
Ow! That's hot. 

616
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,120
If the bakers attempt to remove the delicate sponge from the tin 

617
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,960
before it's completely cool... 

618
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,280
OK! 

619
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,200
..it won't be stable. 

620
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,760
So, I'm just going to go round with a palette knife. 

621
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,440
..and the cake could collapse. 

622
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,320
Better not...! 

623
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,600
Woo! 

624
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,560
Nearly. 

625
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,960
- I think I'm OK. 
- There's a cake. 

626
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,360
There's a cake. It came out easily. 

627
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,440
I'm supposed to cool it upside down, but mine just fell out. 

628
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,960
OK, all right. So, why was that? What did you do to the tin? 

629
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,720
It was well lined. 

630
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,680
Whilst at school Kim was known as the Cake Angel 

631
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,000
as she enterprisingly sold cupcakes to classmates. 

632
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,360
She now works as a psychologist but still makes time to bake every day. 

633
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,480
I wondered if I want a bit more height on it. 

634
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
Do you think it's gone a bit like a squeeze box? 

635
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,000
- I mean, Paul is a size queen. That's all I'll say.
- I know. 

636
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,920
He really is so it might matter to him. 

637
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,000
- She's gone a little bit pottery class, hasn't she?
- Yes. 

638
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,640
It's like a slightly sort of Ghost moment, isn't it? 

639
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,440
Well...who wants to go front, who wants to go back? 

640
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,760
I'm easy, Toby. 

641
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,760
Bakers, you've got ten minutes left on the clock. 

642
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,640
Has it dropped yet? 

643
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,680
No, has it hell! 

644
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,920
It's stuck in there. 

645
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,040
I didn't grease it at all. 

646
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,600
I've got a feeling grease and flour was the way to head. 

647
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,880
I wouldn't worry about that. 

648
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,080
Whoa! 

649
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,400
It's out. 

650
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,600
Oh...! That looks a cracker. 

651
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,200
Jolly good. Right. Game on. 

652
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,000
Why does it taste salty? 

653
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,920
Oh, my God. I've used salt! 

654
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,320
Argh! So, I now have a twisted, deformed, salty... 

655
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,400
Ay, ah! 

656
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,280
Finally, the cake should be covered with whipped Chantilly cream... 

657
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,600
I'd rather try to do something that looks a bit decorative rather 

658
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,480
than just palette knife it on. 

659
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,400
- Oh!
- This is still warm, it's just going to run everywhere 

660
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,440
so I'm not going to cover the whole thing. 

661
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,640
..and drizzled with the lemon and passion fruit curd. 

662
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,520
I don't know whether to do it all over. I'm slightly tempted. 

663
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,720
Not sure how it's going to taste, but I think it looks presentable. 

664
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,800
Bakers, time's up. 

665
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,640
If you could bring up your angel food cakes - 

666
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,440
place them on the altar behind the photograph of yourself. 

667
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,360
'Mary and Paul will be looking for a good rise, light texture 

668
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,760
'and perfect curd. 

669
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,000
'They will have no idea whose cake is whose.' 

670
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,040
What an array... 

671
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
Shall we start from this side then, Mary? 

672
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,520
They cut through very softly. 

673
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,720
It's got a nice texture inside that one, actually. It could be taller. 

674
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,560
It's a lovely texture. It's well baked. 

675
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,160
A good effort, I think. 

676
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,480
This one is quite neat. There's been some attention. 

677
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,440
Very nice structure. Just the right thickness on top. 

678
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,080
The bake on it's good. 

679
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,160
Perhaps this person was short of time. 

680
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,240
The top on it looks a bit of a mess. 

681
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,480
Not a good rise. 

682
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,640
It's a pity, that really is a bit runny, isn't it? 

683
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,360
Nice straight sides here, I think, 

684
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,240
but I've just got to get through the cream. 

685
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,320
The curd's too thin. Quite tight, isn't it, on the structure? 

686
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,400
It's got a bit of a dip in there. 

687
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,760
This has got a very smooth outside and a little bit messy on the top. 

688
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,680
It's quite dense inside. It tastes OK. 

689
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,680
This person obviously had a bit of time to do a bit of piping. 

690
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
It looks straight from the 1970s, doesn't it? 

691
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,360
I can't remember(!) 

692
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,800
THEY LAUGH 

693
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,440
Close textured. 

694
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,000
Not much height. 

695
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,160
I like the appearance of the passion fruit curd. 

696
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,880
I quite like the look of that one. It's got quite a nice structure 

697
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,760
- in there as well, hasn't it? 
- There's a lighter structure there... 

698
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,200
Mmm. That's nice and light. Good flavour. 

699
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,240
The sides look slightly more on a slant. 

700
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,280
That one's been greased, you can see how small that is. 

701
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,000
The side has got a pleat in it because it's slipped down the tin... 

702
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
Then we have someone who's piped this again here. 

703
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,600
That's very dense, it's very small. 

704
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,840
It's just been executed wrongly with the tin. 

705
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,200
The passion fruit's there, a little bit on the runny side. 

706
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,520
It's dense again, isn't it? 

707
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,200
It's collapsed down when it's come out of the oven. 

708
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,040
Now this one, instead of having the straight sides, 

709
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,520
it has sloping sides. 

710
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,080
If it's turned out when it's warm, 

711
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,400
it then naturally spreads to the side. 

712
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,800
Another one that's had a bit of extra time to do 

713
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,000
the piping around the outside. 

714
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,040
It hasn't climbed up too much at all 

715
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,640
and, again, less volume in the meringue as well. 

716
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,680
Finally, this one's had a few major issues. 

717
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,640
It's sort of leaning. 

718
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,880
- It's had no rise at all. 
- Oh, dear. 

719
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,320
- And it's raw.
- Also, it's raw. 

720
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,040
Salt...don't try that, Mary. 

721
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,720
Someone screwed up with the recipe. 

722
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,960
It has happened before. 

723
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,560
- Salt Run Barber John 2012. 
- Yes. But look what happened to John. 

724
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:53,360
Paul and Mary will now rank the angel food cakes from worst to best. 

725
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,280
Number 13 is here. 

726
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,600
I'm so sorry. 

727
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,880
12th position is this one, there was no cream around the outside. 

728
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,160
11 is this one. It was just close textured. 

729
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,880
And in 10th place is this one. Did you grease your tin? 

730
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,400
It fell out and that's why it was so dense. 

731
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,680
'Deborah, Beca, Frances, Howard, Mark and Glenn 

732
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,520
'produced angel food cakes 

733
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,040
'not quite good enough to make the top three.' 

734
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,360
Number three is right here. 

735
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,920
We had beautiful smooth sides, good flavour. 

736
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,840
And number two is this one. 

737
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,640
The structure was there, the curd was excellent. 

738
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,800
And you'll all know now who is number one. Well done. 

739
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,480
ALL: Robert! APPLAUSE 

740
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,240
- Technically, really good. 
- Thank you.
- Well done. 

741
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,160
- Congratulations to all of you. 
- Well done, bakers. 

742
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,920
Well done! 

743
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,520
'It's quite a moment to be the top out of a group of 13.' 

744
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,120
There's some good bakers there 

745
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,440
and I was expecting to come, probably about halfway. 

746
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,040
It would have been lovely to have come first, but third is great. 

747
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,560
From semi-good to absolutely disastrous 

748
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,560
is basically the summing up of today. 

749
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,600
I'm absolutely at the bottom of the pile without a doubt. 

750
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,640
SHEEP BLEAT 

751
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,720
'Just one challenge to go before someone will be crowned 

752
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,800
'Star Baker and one, or maybe two, bakers are sent home.' 

753
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,160
So, Paul and Mary, it's like a bewildering blizzard of bakes. 

754
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,280
- 13 bakers.
- It's very difficult with so many people, but I think there's 

755
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,800
two standing out from the pack as the Star Baker, I think. 

756
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,480
Lucy pulled off a pretty amazing tulip cake. 

757
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,800
Have I ever used tulip petals? Never! 

758
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,200
And they held up beautifully. 

759
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,160
Rob with his fantastic pecan sandwich cake. 

760
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,520
You watch how he worked. He was meticulous. 

761
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,640
He's a scientist. Is that going to help him, Paul? 

762
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,960
He's not a scientist, that guy's a baker. 

763
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,680
Ruby had a fairly intense day of it. 

764
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,560
In the technical, when you're in the last three you are in trouble. 

765
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,000
Toby was certainly in the last three, he came bottom. 

766
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,160
His signature cake was good, so that could save him. 

767
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,640
Depends on how he does today. 

768
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,720
Ali balanced flavours quite brilliantly 

769
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
with his rose sandwich cake, 

770
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,080
but was 11th in the technical. 

771
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,200
The ball is in his court. 

772
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,440
Coming into the Showstopper is entirely up to him. 

773
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,120
Morning, bakers. So this is the Showstopper Challenge and, 

774
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,920
for today's challenge, we'd like you to bake a chocolate cake, 

775
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,080
but not just any old chocolate cake. 

776
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,640
We are looking for a magnificent chocolate cake. 

777
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,680
We want you to go coco-loco. 

778
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,400
We want tiers if you like, it can be a novelty cake, 

779
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,720
although do bear in mind, 

780
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,880
when you're thinking of the novelty, it is 8pm, BBC Two! 

781
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,480
The judges would love you to use at least 

782
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,080
two types of chocolate to decorate your cake. 

783
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,280
So, anything from the dark, milk, white arena would be great. 

784
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,920
Use all three, that would be very pleasing. 

785
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,920
Now, Mary and Paul are going to be looking for elaborate 

786
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,480
decoration on your cakes. 

787
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,160
You've got four hours on the clock so on your marks. 

788
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,520
- Get set.
- BOTH: Bake! 

789
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,640
Creating a showstopper chocolate masterpiece requires 

790
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,240
several demanding cake making skills. 

791
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,560
I like the way you've put little labels on everything. 

792
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,280
- Well, I need to. 
- You obviously need to. 

793
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,920
'The ability to perfect moist, full-flavoured chocolate sponges...' 

794
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,120
And you've got every bowl labelled and also every jug. 

795
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,320
..mastery of the fickle art of tempering... 

796
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,120
- Keep an eye on your jugs. 
- ..striking construction... 

797
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,760
Flour! Where's the flour? 

798
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,200
..and flawless decoration... 

799
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,000
Nothing! Nothing could go wrong! 

800
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,600
..all in just four hours. 

801
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,960
That was going to be - 25 plus one - one o'clock. 

802
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,680
- Not everyone is starting with chocolate.
- I read about it 

803
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,520
a while ago and I thought it was a really interesting combination. 

804
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,480
They used a thyme ice cream which they coated with chocolate. 

805
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,720
That sort of created the theme of my whole cake. 

806
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,320
Lucy's Showstopper is her wild wood cake, 

807
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,400
decorated with dark chocolate trees and infused with thyme. 

808
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,040
I'm going to just pick off individual thyme leaves 

809
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,880
and scatter them over the top of my baking parchment 

810
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,080
so that it'll infuse into my sponge, keep the flavour really fresh. 

811
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,280
'I'm going for an engagement themed cake. 

812
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,040
'It's something I made for a friend for his engagement party.' 

813
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,760
He was a little short of cash. 

814
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,160
Ali's engagement cake will be topped with white chocolate ganache 

815
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,640
and piped dark chocolate butterflies, 

816
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,000
and he's taking a risk with his sponge mix. 

817
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,680
I am worried because a few other contestants were 

818
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,800
surprised that I was using fresh raspberries. 

819
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,720
But I'm not using a whole field worth of raspberries, just a few. 

820
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,680
I want that richness from the chocolate 

821
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,640
but then you get a burst of raspberries to cut through that. 

822
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,320
I found it quite difficult to get the sponge recipe right, 

823
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,720
because it's got fat in it, it's got sugar in it - 

824
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,760
it disrupts the ratio that you would usually use of things. 

825
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,560
I think today I'm just trying to force myself to be calm. 

826
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,440
Ruby's chocolate and ginger cake will be 

827
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,280
wrapped in an asymmetrical tempered dark chocolate collar. 

828
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,560
How did you feel last night when you got back? 

829
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,400
- Traumatised.
- So, you study philosophy, do you not? 

830
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,880
Is there any philosophy that you would draw on currently? 

831
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,600
Well, Berkeley says, "If something isn't perceived by anyone then it doesn't exist," 

832
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,000
so if you can turn your backs the other way when I bring my cake out. 

833
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,200
Unfortunately, the only flaw in that is this is a competition in which 

834
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,800
there are judges so someone will gaze upon your produce, 

835
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,240
so then it will exist. 

836
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,800
Well...I've got to pull it out of the bag. 

837
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,040
Baking a perfect chocolate cake isn't straightforward. 

838
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,040
We're away! 

839
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,400
The darker colour makes it harder to see when it's baked. 

840
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,920
For those attempting a tiered Showstopper... 

841
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,920
Relief they're in! 

842
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,080
- ..they will have to juggle several sponges...
- They're rising though. 

843
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,120
- ..all of different sizes... 
- Two of the middle ones in. 

844
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,680
..each one requiring a different baking time. 

845
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,960
I'm going to need another timer. 

846
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,200
I don't do gender cliches, 

847
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,440
but I suspect I'm not massively good at multitasking. 

848
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,400
Shards of tempered white and dark chocolate will decorate 

849
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,000
Toby's giant, triple layered, two-tiered Showstopper. 

850
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,560
That's like the size of the ten-inch 

851
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,960
and then there's the three eight-inch on top. 

852
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,440
So, big enough for a couple with a healthy appetite. 

853
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,160
I thought it was big enough for Paul. 

854
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,040
Yes, Paul will get through that. 

855
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,280
Good luck. 

856
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,680
But Toby's cake might not be the biggest. 

857
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,000
And these are the last two of seven. 

858
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,200
Glenn's almond and espresso chocolate showstopper is 

859
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,560
inspired by one of the world's most famous architects. 

860
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,520
I've lived in Barcelona for a while 

861
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,320
- and I massively loved all Gaudi buildings.
- Gaudi. Brilliant. 

862
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,440
So, the bottom layer's got a sort of swirl which reminds me 

863
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:07,000
of columns in the Park Guell, the second has some sort of tiles. 

864
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
The top layer is fairly smooth but has towers. 

865
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,640
So, how high is it going to be? 

866
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,080
About here. 

867
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,920
I think I'll need a ladder to see it. 

868
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:21,200
Bakers, you are halfway through your showstopper jaunt. 

869
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,680
Two hours left. 

870
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,920
Success! Ha-ha! 

871
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,080
Yep, they're done. 

872
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,120
Still wet inside. 

873
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,400
That's four and five out. 

874
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,920
And six and seven. 

875
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,440
Stupid oven! 

876
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,960
So many issues. 

877
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,640
I set the time, but I didn't press start 

878
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,200
so I've had to just purely do it by just my own testing. 

879
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,360
I sliced my thing... 

880
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,720
whilst I was chopping butter. 

881
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,800
I'm going to throw in the towel soon! 

882
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,840
While their cakes are cooling, the bakers spend every minute 

883
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,400
perfecting their showstopping chocolate toppings 

884
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,000
and decorations. 

885
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,880
These have got to be meticulously clean. 

886
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,000
Any water or fat on them will ruin the temper. 

887
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,840
Tempering involves heating 

888
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,600
and then cooling chocolate to a specific temperature. 

889
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:27,920
I need it around 31 and then I'll mix in unmelted chocolate to 

890
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,520
bring the temperature down. 

891
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,080
It's all about crystal structure. 

892
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,000
When it reaches the right temperature, 

893
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,120
the only crystals that are in there are from the good chocolate. 

894
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,240
Once set, the cocoa butter should solidify in a form that is crisp... 

895
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,240
- This is where it gets messy. 
- ..and glossy. 

896
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,120
Using acetate extra-ensures that it's going to be nice and shiny. 

897
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,240
Those have worked really well. Are you pleased? 

898
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,680
Yeah, they're all right. 

899
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,480
You can tell the ones that have tempered better. 

900
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,200
You've got a tiny temper there. 

901
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,480
Now these are going to hopefully settle... 

902
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,560
Just one degree out and they'll have unforgivably dull chocolate. 

903
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,400
This is really nerve-racking. 

904
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,960
Are you making balloon animals? 

905
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,440
No. No, no. These are to make... 

906
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,840
What are you doing? 

907
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,520
I'm going to dip them in chocolate and stand them on a cold surface so 

908
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,840
that they form a bowl and then, whatever runs down, forms the base. 

909
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,040
Rob's raspberry and chocolate showstopper will be enclosed 

910
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,280
by white and dark chocolate shards 

911
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,800
and topped with his balloon chocolate cups, 

912
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,080
which will feature yet another feat of precision - 

913
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,680
chocolate engineering. 

914
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,360
I tried the chocolate striped cigars a few times 

915
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,000
with no success whatsoever 

916
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,120
and then I tried it the other day and it worked so I'm going with it. 

917
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,200
On the strength of that one trial... 

918
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,040
Ah-ha! I'll quit there because that's worked. 

919
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,760
I don't want to push my luck. 

920
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,160
Howard is attempting to go one better. 

921
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,880
It's a bit of a revisited black forest gateau. 

922
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,360
It's going to have a little model chocolate bear. 

923
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,040
It's basically a modelling chocolate given a little dusting to 

924
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,240
make it more of a silver grey bear. 

925
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,400
Howard's bear will stand guard on top of a rectangular 

926
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,000
dark chocolate sponge filled with cream cheese 

927
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,560
and cherries soaked in kirsch. 

928
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,960
I'm not terribly fond of chocolate, in fact, chocolate gives me 

929
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,360
migraines so I avoid chocolate. 

930
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,880
This is certainly a bit of an ambitious bake. 

931
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:24,080
Wanting to pull out all the stops, or squirrels in my case so... 

932
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,200
it's a secret squirrel three-tiered tree trunk cake 

933
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,840
with a hidden chocolate hazelnut squirrel in the top trunk. 

934
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,880
Each of Frances' tiers will feature 

935
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,200
a differently flavoured marble sponge. 

936
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,160
She's using walnuts, almonds and hazelnuts 

937
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,280
and squirrels don't just feature on the inside. 

938
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,520
Is it the Bake Off squirrel? 

939
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,320
We could make it the Bake Off squirrel. 

940
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,760
If you do make it the Bake Off squirrel, you might need to 

941
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,520
add a little bit in certain areas. 

942
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,360
- I think we should make a Big Bake Off squirrel.
- That could be fun. 

943
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,280
Whole nut is the operative word, Frances. 

944
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,280
Mark has also decided to bake some extra decoration. 

945
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,720
Awesome. 

946
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,200
His profiteroles will top a giant chocolate sponge made 

947
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,600
with buttermilk and his showstopper will be wrapped 

948
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,040
in a striped white and milk chocolate collar. 

949
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,720
Oh, it's not going to stay. 

950
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,080
That is not going to stay... 

951
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,160
Um... 

952
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,920
No. I need sellotape. 

953
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,960
Uh... 

954
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,960
Yes, I'm not very organised at this point. 

955
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,200
Mark's not the only one in trouble. 

956
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,960
My ganache has gone wrong. 

957
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,120
This is meant to be a lot more set than it is. 

958
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,160
As you can see, it's very runny. 

959
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,840
There's no way this will set in time. 

960
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,280
I've cut myself several times and grated my thumb... 

961
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,320
- It's slowed me... 
- TIMER BEEPS 

962
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,240
Oh, sorry. Right, OK. 

963
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,760
Shall I just leave that now? 

964
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,960
Just leave that till it seizes. Put it in the fridge. 

965
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,720
Cover it. 

966
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,600
I'll leave the rest to the one up there... 

967
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,680
Well, and Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry. 

968
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:57,040
OK, bakers, just half an hour left until chocolate coronary o'clock. 

969
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,840
Half an hour's fine. Half an hour we can work with. 

970
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,960
- I'm, uh, behind.
- Yup. 

971
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,960
- Stressed.
- Yup. 

972
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,880
Slightly doolally. 

973
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,680
These are optimal conditions for Bake Off. 

974
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,240
Oh! It's not cold enough yet and I'm worried. 

975
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,160
My concerns are quite serious that some of them are 

976
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,840
not going to be finished on time. 

977
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,760
Oh! Oh, it was like it was meant to be! 

978
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,400
Four hours to do this is enough. 

979
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,160
HE PRAYS UNDER HIS BREATH 

980
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,960
It's just that it's our first showstopper. 

981
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,600
I really think that some of them have been too ambitious. 

982
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,080
It would be a tragedy if his head falls off. 

983
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,440
Tried to fit in too much, too many stages... 

984
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,040
(She's amazing!) 

985
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,520
..and make it too grand. 

986
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,080
Come on. It would not be a Bake Off squirrel without a pair of hazelnuts. 

987
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,920
- There we go.
- We told them the time, we told them what we wanted. 

988
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,360
They've had time to practise... 

989
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,040
Plonk that on top now. 

990
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,280
..if they can't do it. 

991
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,640
The whole point of the challenge was the chocolate decoration, 

992
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,840
so as far as I'm concerned that's a big fat zero. 

993
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,760
Baker's dozen, you've got five minutes left 

994
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,640
on this Showstopper Challenge... 

995
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,920
Five minutes are left to you. 

996
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,680
Come on, come on, come on. 

997
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,360
It hasn't worked. 

998
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,880
Damn! Ugh! 

999
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,240
HE LAUGHS 

1000
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,880
MEL GASPS 

1001
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,520
(Oh, that looks so good!) 

1002
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,440
HEAVY BREATHING 

1003
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,320
I've seen uglier things. 

1004
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,320
OK, bakers, that's one minute left. 

1005
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,160
Holy crap! 

1006
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,720
Please don't break, please don't break, please don't break...! 

1007
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,080
Oh, you son of a...! 

1008
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,080
Bakers, that's the end of the bake. 

1009
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:34,200
Time to put down all chocolate tools and step away, please. 

1010
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,240
To the second! 

1011
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,040
HE SIGHS 

1012
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,800
HE LAUGHS 

1013
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,600
'That is the worst bake I've ever baked in my life' 

1014
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,800
and yet this is what's going to make Paul and Mary decide 

1015
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,480
whether I'm staying or going. 

1016
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,800
Fate decided. 

1017
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:03,080
It's judgment time for the chocolate showstoppers. 

1018
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,840
Rob, do you want to come up, please. 

1019
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,440
'I think I've done a reasonable job. 

1020
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,520
'The bit that went really well was the chocolate cigars.' 

1021
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,120
Dead pleased with that. 

1022
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,640
The overall appearance and thought of it is exceptional. 

1023
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,800
And I thought your little balloons... 

1024
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,400
I can just imagine having a go at that and it not working for me! 

1025
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,960
The flavour in it's good. I got the filling, I got the raspberry. 

1026
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,480
It's beautifully presented, 

1027
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,360
the lovely flavour of the chocolate, the impact of that. 

1028
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,480
You couldn't pass it without glancing and saying well done. 

1029
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,680
- ROB:
- Thank you. 
- True scientist. 

1030
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,040
Part of being able to bake in this environment is 

1031
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,080
not cutting yourself and impairing your ability...! 

1032
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,160
Would they take this into consideration. 

1033
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,080
Would it help, as it were...? 

1034
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,360
Um? I don't see how, really. 

1035
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,560
- It's a mess. 
- Of course, yes, absolutely. 

1036
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,440
On top there's tempering work. We know where it should've been. 

1037
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,400
If you'd put that round the side that would've made it look better. 

1038
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,920
No thumbs! 

1039
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,840
It's hard to put on some panels with no thumbs. 

1040
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,560
- PAUL:
- We're judging the cake. 

1041
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,200
- Your cake's overbaked.
- Yeah. 
- There's not much flavour in it. 

1042
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,360
A positive point - your three layers are exactly matching. 

1043
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,160
- The cake itself is dry.
- Yeah. 

1044
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,640
If I'd had a bit more time I would have allowed my icing to set 

1045
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,080
a bit more and then I would have got a better finish. 

1046
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,880
I think I've shown the chocolate skills that I've got in this cake. 

1047
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,120
I hope that is enough. 

1048
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,840
I love your trees. 

1049
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,880
- I really feel it's a walk in the woods, don't you?
- It is, yeah. 

1050
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,920
I just think that it's a little bit too rough around the outside. 

1051
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,040
You've spent so much time on the trees 

1052
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,680
that you've lost the overall appearance of the cake. 

1053
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,440
Looks a nice sponge here. 

1054
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,360
I've just got some thyme... 

1055
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,920
and I like the flavour of that. 

1056
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,600
It's a little bit dense but it's beautifully moist. 

1057
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,960
The thyme comes in and deadens it slightly at the end 

1058
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,360
rather than lifts it up. 

1059
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,960
It looks volcanic, doesn't it? 

1060
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,680
- It's big.
- You used the milk chocolate, 

1061
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,960
didn't you, on the outside? 

1062
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,480
- I did.
- You never get a good finish with something like that. 

1063
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,720
Are you literally going to eat your hat, Christine? 

1064
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,480
I don't know about all of it. 

1065
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,480
It looks exciting, it looks fun 

1066
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,600
and what a lovely shine on the brim. 

1067
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,960
Your truffles look great and you've tempered extremely well. 

1068
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,120
It's a good cake. 

1069
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:44,120
You've got a little bit of moisture coming from that filling as well. 

1070
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,240
It's a very good cake. 

1071
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,080
The chocolate one is slightly overbaked. 

1072
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,840
The bake time and the overall appearance on the side 

1073
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,520
has to be improved. 

1074
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,360
I love the taste of fresh raspberries. 

1075
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,640
The flavours go beautifully together. 

1076
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,560
I absolutely adore it. I really do. 

1077
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,520
The only thing that upsets me is the side. 

1078
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,840
Glenn, come forth with your tower. 

1079
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,200
I should probably make an apology now to all my students who 

1080
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,040
I lecture about planning and working to a deadline, 

1081
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,840
because in there that was all out the window. 

1082
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,280
Your first cake that you did for us was the biggest in the room. 

1083
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,440
This one, I've just looked round, it is the tallest. 

1084
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,280
Can you do little things? 

1085
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,920
I don't know. Well, if I'm still here in a couple of weeks' time, 

1086
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,360
I'll see if I can manage a petit four. 

1087
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,920
- PAUL:
- They're all far too dry and not carrying any flavour. 

1088
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,480
- Oh.
- Which is a shame. 

1089
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,800
That is a masterpiece. 

1090
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,080
Has that little bear got a name? 

1091
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,160
- HOWARD:
- It could be Paul. 
- THEY LAUGH 

1092
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,680
Well, it's got a nice smile. 

1093
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,480
It was meant to have slightly brighter blue eyes. 

1094
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,760
It's very moist and indulgent, isn't it? 

1095
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,200
I love it. I think it's been executed well, it looks fantastic. 

1096
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,400
- Thumbs up, Howard. 
- Thank you very much, Howard. 

1097
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,560
THEY LAUGH 

1098
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,960
You're very creative with your bakes. 

1099
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,880
You've done it again with this one. The idea is good. 

1100
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,760
It's been executed well. 

1101
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,400
Don't chop the squirrel's nuts off! 

1102
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,280
Amazing. We've got a hidden treasure of a squirrel. 

1103
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,840
You can see all the different chocolates that you've used. 

1104
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:29,040
You've succeeded in getting a really moist well-flavoured cake. 

1105
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,840
Ali, if you'd like to come up with your cake? 

1106
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,000
'This one was make or break and, um...' 

1107
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,040
I think it's broken me. 

1108
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,600
I'm better than that cake, but that's all they can judge me on. 

1109
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,720
It looks, if I might say, a little bit childish. 

1110
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:53,080
Oh, yes, completely. I'm actually ashamed to put it in front of you. 

1111
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,480
What are the hard bits inside the cake? 

1112
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,560
Passion fruit seed. I took it out last time, 

1113
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,960
I thought I should keep them in. 

1114
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,400
You don't put it inside a chocolate cake. It's strange. 

1115
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,880
You eat the chocolate cake and then crunch - "Is that my filling?" 

1116
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,920
It's a good chocolate cake, in as much as it's moist. 

1117
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,680
You got that right, but you're sad about this and we are too. 

1118
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,680
At the end of yesterday I was dead certain I was going to go out. 

1119
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,080
It's far from perfect and a bit rough around the edges, 

1120
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,120
but it was finished which is the first time so far, 

1121
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,720
so if I go out now then 

1122
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,920
I've done a decent showing of my last bake. 

1123
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,960
You've tempered the chocolate, you've got a bit of shine on it. 

1124
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,560
It's lost some of it when it's been manipulated onto the cake itself. 

1125
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,560
- And you've got ginger in the filling as well.
- RUBY:
- Yeah, I do. 

1126
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,560
I like that. It goes. 

1127
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,160
- Oh, good!
- It's successful. 

1128
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,440
- PAUL:
- I like that. 

1129
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,120
Oh, that's such a relief. 

1130
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,160
The ginger gives it a little bit of heat as well. 

1131
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,040
It sits on the palate once you've had it. 

1132
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,120
For me, the only problem with that is the decoration is too simple. 

1133
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,000
- Thank you very much.
- Not too bad. 
- Well done, Ruby.
- Thank you. 

1134
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,520
They await your decision. 

1135
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,120
Paul and Mary must now decide whose cakes were good enough 

1136
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,080
to see them crowned this year's first Star Baker 

1137
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,240
and who will have to leave the competition. 

1138
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,680
I think, generally, the standard in the Showstoppers 

1139
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,240
has been very, very high. I think Howard stood out for me, 

1140
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,000
I thought Frances stood out. I thought Rob stood out as well. 

1141
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,440
They all did exceptional things. Very clever things. 

1142
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,680
- Innovative skills.
- In week one. 
- Yeah, in week one! 

1143
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,760
Do you know who's in line for Star Baker? 

1144
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,480
It's pretty tight at the top, isn't it? 

1145
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,040
- We are in total agreement about that.
- Are you? 

1146
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,720
Are you? That's a first. 

1147
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,720
Are there a huddle of those who have slightly underwhelmed 

1148
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,640
who you think are now in trouble? 

1149
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,120
I think Ali was just overwhelmed by the whole thing. 

1150
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,920
Obviously, nerves have caused a lot of injuries 

1151
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,520
and Toby's managed to slice both of his thumbs. 

1152
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,960
It doesn't affect how long a cake stays in an oven for. 

1153
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,320
If it's dry, it's dry. Toby's in trouble. 

1154
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,880
I would even throw Ruby in there as well. 

1155
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,720
The rhubarb and custard did have issues, 

1156
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,560
she was 12th in the technical. 

1157
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,600
And also added in to the mix, possibly two might go this week. 

1158
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,960
Who knows. 

1159
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,800
Gosh, she's a sphinx, isn't she? 

1160
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,440
- (I know - the enigma.) 
- I know. Wrapped in a mystery. 

1161
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,280
Baker's dozen, as you know, 

1162
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:38,840
every Bake Off we like to tell you who has been the Star Baker. 

1163
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:42,240
Now, this person has shown deliciousness, 

1164
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,000
a big dash of precision engineering 

1165
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,440
and enough potential to go to outer space. 

1166
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,800
- It's Rob. Well done. 
- Well done. Fantastic. 

1167
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,480
APPLAUSE 

1168
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,560
It is, of course, a baker's dozen. 

1169
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,320
For one of you, 13 IS the unlucky number. 

1170
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,160
I hate doing this, but one of you, unfortunately, 

1171
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,600
has to leave this weekend... 

1172
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,040
and the person that won't be joining us next week is... 

1173
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,320
- ..Toby.
- Yes. 

1174
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,000
I'm really, really gutted, Toby. 

1175
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,400
Sandwich him, sandwich him immediately. Sandwich in. 

1176
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,120
Oh, dear. I got one thing correct this weekend 

1177
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:39,000
and that's that I was going to be the one to be kicked out. 

1178
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,120
I really sympathise with Toby. It just didn't get together. 

1179
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:46,000
Bake Off, series four. Standards are very, very high. 

1180
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,280
You can't afford any slip ups. 

1181
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,040
The Showstopper really has to be outstanding, and it wasn't, 

1182
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:54,440
and even the chocolate cake itself didn't have that flavour. 

1183
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,680
- TOBY:
- I think I'm going to give up baking 

1184
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,240
and become some kind of anti-baking monk... 

1185
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,800
Or not! 

1186
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,000
Dude, does it look as though I'm going to stop eating cake? 

1187
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,600
CHEERING 

1188
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,560
- ALI:
- 'As I was sitting in that row, I was so certain' 

1189
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,080
they were going to say Ali... 

1190
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,040
There you go. Come on. 

1191
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,200
I'm so excited. I'm so excited. 

1192
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,680
Oh, come here. I'm sorry. 

1193
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,440
'I think I've learnt just to...' 

1194
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,080
not panic. 

1195
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,760
The other little sausage! 

1196
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,960
THEY LAUGH 

1197
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,760
'I've just got Star Baker and I think' 

1198
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,400
that's fantastic. It doesn't get better than that in baking! 

1199
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,880
No, not here! 

1200
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,520
Hello? 

1201
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,520
It's Dad. Guess what! 

1202
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,200
Daddy got through! 

1203
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,600
Yeah! Yeah! 

1204
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,280
Yeah! 

1205
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,840
- HIGH-PITCHED: 
- "Mum, Daddy got through!" 

1206
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,880
- Next time...
- I said I wouldn't be one of those lunatics 

1207
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,000
- kneeling on the floor by the oven. 
- ..it's bread week.
- And here I am! 

1208
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,720
And, this year, Paul's expectations... 

1209
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,800
What you've got there is a baseball bat. 

1210
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,360
..have risen higher than ever. 

1211
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,400
Welcome to yeast. 

1212
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,040
He's after signature breadsticks... 

1213
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,160
Living on the edge. 

1214
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,960
..technically perfect muffins... 

1215
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,080
(I don't think anyone else has done them.) 

1216
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,480
..And show stopping... 

1217
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,680
- Very satisfying. 
- ..decorative loaves. 

1218
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,560
It's a Paul the psychic octopus tribute loaf. 

1219
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,320
- Of course it is. 
- But who will be crowned Star Baker? 

1220
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,880
Don't give me a round of applause, it bloody stuck to the tray! 

1221
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,640
And whose Bake Off will come to an end? 

1222
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,640
I might just give it an extra few minutes, on reflection... 

1223
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,880
