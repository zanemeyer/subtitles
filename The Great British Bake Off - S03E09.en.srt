1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,880
OK, so, what do you get if you cross four remaining bakers, 

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,480
three devilishly difficult challenges, 

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,120
two very demanding judges, and one large white tent. 

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,000
- Big holes all over Australia! 
- No, Sue. 

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,480
It's the semifinals of The Great British Bake Off. 

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,080
- Of course it is. I told you that. 
- Knock knock.
- Who's there? 

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,960
- Paul Hollywood.
- Hello. 

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,000
Last week... 

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,640
Oh, I'm not ready! 

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,640
..it was a biscuit-based quarter-final. 

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,720
John rediscovered his early promise. 

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,800
I think it's a magnificent construction. 

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,480
- Brendan... 
- The male will have a cockscomb. 

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,040
..did what he does best. 

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,600
It's a bit much for me, to be honest. 

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,880
- Danny...
- Ah!
- ..clung on. 

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,560
- You stay there. 
- And, for the first time... 

18
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,920
- That caramel's just rubbish.
- '..one of James's ambitious experiments...' 

19
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,480
- Oh, Sue.
- What have you done darling? 

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,280
'..didn't go to plan.' 

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,800
This is a total disaster. 

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,120
But, it was Cathryn... 

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,880
Honestly, I've completely lost it. 

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,760
..whose bake off had to end. 

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,520
I am not surprised. A little bit heart-broken. 

26
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,280
'Tonight...' 

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,400
Semi-final, mate. 

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,840
'..the remaining four head across the Channel...' 

29
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,360
- Bonjour, hello.
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour. 

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,280
..to reach miniature signature bake perfection... 

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,360
The flavour's there, the texture's there, but the look is terrible. 

32
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,640
..achieve flawless technical brilliance... 

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,000
That's a nice cake, that, Mary. 

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,080
My creme pat's has got cellulite, at the moment. 

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,200
..and create show-stopping... 

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,440
Oh, my God! 

37
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,720
..choux pastry gateau. 

38
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,040
Go right through how you're constructing this. 

39
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,640
I don't know. 

40
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,000
- But whose prayers will be answered?
- Come on! 

41
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,600
And whose bake off... 

42
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,000
I think, another 30 seconds. 

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,360
..won't go the distance. 

44
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,120
The person who will not be joining us next week 

45
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,560
for The Great British Bake Off final is... 

46
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,680
I don't know what the hell I can do, then, cos it's just not working. 

47
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,000
Of course, Sue, it is French week. 

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,320
- So, so why are you doing Hungarian accent?
- I don't know. 

49
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,200
I don't know, either! 

50
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,000
- Zut alors!
- I don't care. 

51
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,880
- BRENDAN:
- This is going to be quite a stressful day, 

52
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,360
but, it's the stepping stone towards the final, 

53
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,920
and that's what I've wanted, right from the start. 

54
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,160
- JOHN:
- To think that the final is just one step away, 

55
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,360
I feel absolutely sick with nerves. 

56
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,560
I've got butterflies in my stomach, and I'm choked, up here. 

57
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,360
- DANNY:
- It's been awfully stressful, at times. 

58
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,400
It's been emotionally all over the place. 

59
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,720
- JAMES:
- The atmosphere is a little different. 

60
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,240
The atmosphere's a little bit more tense. 

61
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,320
Everyone's a little bit more withdrawn. 

62
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,720
Welcome, boulanger et boulangere. 

63
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,800
Today, what we'd like you to do, is to prepare the classic 

64
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,480
after-dinner French treat, petits fours. 

65
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,760
You can do meringues, choux pastry, biscuit. 

66
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,080
Anything you like, but three types, and we need 12 of each. 

67
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,400
- On your marks. 
- Get set.
- And good luck, and bake. 

68
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,600
Petits four literally means small oven, and gets its name 

69
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,360
from the coal-fired brick ovens of 18th century France. 

70
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,880
Expensive to run, no heat was wasted, 

71
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,640
so very high temperatures, 

72
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,040
le grand four, was used to bake large cakes. 

73
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,840
And, as the ovens cooled, the lower heat, 

74
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,480
le petits fours, was used to cook 

75
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,480
delicate after-dinner cakes, tarts, 

76
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,720
macaroons, meringues and patisserie. 

77
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,280
Petits fours are tricky to make. 

78
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,280
First of all, you're wanting something really rather small. 

79
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,920
A true petit four is one mouthful. 

80
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,280
Don't forget, a petit four is eaten after your meal. 

81
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,440
This is at the time when you're sitting there, going... 

82
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,160
and you've got your coffee, and you look down, 

83
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,120
and they deliver another plate of delights. 

84
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,280
It has to be small, they have to be exquisite, and at this level, 

85
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,040
they have to be perfect. 

86
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,880
All the bakers must demonstrate a different baking 

87
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,360
discipline on each of their three varieties of petits fours. 

88
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,080
- BRENDAN:
- What I'm striving for, in order to qualify for a final place, 

89
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,840
which has been my ambition from the start, is absolute uniformity, 

90
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,120
great flavours and contrasts, 

91
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,560
and really exciting to the eyes. 

92
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,440
So, I suppose that suggests I've got 

93
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,720
some perfectionist tendencies, and I do. 

94
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,840
It can make me a bit difficult to live with, 

95
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,280
because I won't compromise, in that sense. 

96
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,480
Brendan's making coffee meringues filled with hazelnut cream, 

97
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,480
miniature apricots and pistachio sponge cakes, known as friands, 

98
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,680
and choux pastry cygnets. 

99
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,720
Hang on, hang on. By cygnet, do you mean a small swan? 

100
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,960
- As in a small swan. 
- So, you make a little swan? Wow! 

101
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,200
And I just thought, to give it some kick, 

102
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,320
I would put in some freshly made lime curd, 

103
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,320
before the Chantilly goes on. 

104
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,960
Will they be sitting on a blue buttercream sea? 

105
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,200
With fish bobbing up, marzipan fish! 

106
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,600
Well, they'll provides a great contrast, I think, to the friands, 

107
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,080
and the meringues. 

108
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,520
It all sounds very technical, to me, 

109
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,920
but you're totally able to cope with that. 

110
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,400
- Thank you, Mary.
- And I bet you they'll all match in size. 

111
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,200
Three bakers have chosen to make macaroons, 

112
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,320
by gently folding sugar and ground almonds into stiff egg white. 

113
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,400
But, one of them is taking this French classic 

114
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,040
down a less traditional path. 

115
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,000
Just making some chilli sugar. 

116
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,440
I've got a whole chilli in here, 

117
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,080
not sure how wise that was. 

118
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,000
James is making fresh lemon and rhubarb tarts, 

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,800
hazelnut biscuit and chocolate brownie towers, 

120
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,280
and his chilli sugar will top his lime and raspberry macaroons. 

121
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,920
Just think, the chilli, lime, in a macaroon. 

122
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,360
- Have you had that flavour combination before, Paul?
- No. 

123
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,360
- Have you not?
- No. 

124
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,280
- You surprise me.
- Was it new to you? 

125
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,720
It was, when I discovered it. 

126
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,280
Paul is silent, that's a worry. 

127
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,320
I'm just thinking, the time they've got, 

128
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,840
it's quite tricky to come up with a decent macaroon. 

129
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,800
Good luck to you, James. 

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,160
All the petits fours must look identical. 

131
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,160
And, with no case or tin to contain them, 

132
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,040
the macaroons have to be piped with total accuracy. 

133
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,160
- JAMES:
- I feel under a lot of time pressure today, so it's hard to tell 

134
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,760
if that's because I'm feeling more competitive, or what. 

135
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,880
Tapping removes any air bubbles which could balloon in the oven, 

136
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,360
and ruin the macaroons' appearance. 

137
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,480
For a shiny top, the batter needs to rest, 

138
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,600
so a smooth skin forms. 

139
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,760
You've just got to leave them in the air, so that, 

140
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,120
when you just very gently put your finger on them, 

141
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,720
they feel touch dry. 

142
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,760
You can't, sort of, stick your finger in, 

143
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,960
cos that will ruin the structure of them. 

144
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,720
Along with her blackberry and peppermint macaroons, 

145
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,200
Danny's making miniature raspberry financiers, 

146
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,120
and langues de chat. 

147
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,040
What is a langues de chat? 

148
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,440
Literally, langues de chat is cat's tongue, 

149
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,280
supposed to be a cat's tongue, licking a bowl of milk. 

150
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,920
Whether they do or not, when they're done, we'll see! 

151
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,800
Langues de chat. 

152
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,360
I like them, but the kind you get in biscuits at Christmas, 

153
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,320
are usually a bit hard, and disappointing. 

154
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,640
So, that's why I'm dipping these in chocolate. 

155
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,680
- You're looking very French, Danny, with the stripy T-shirt.
- Yeah. 

156
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,880
Like myself. 

157
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,320
- It's very good.
- Trying.
- Channel your French, channel your French. 

158
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,520
- Absolutely. Channel my inner French.
- Yeah. 

159
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,720
Bakers, if this was the Tour de France, you'd be in the, oh, 

160
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,720
I'd say, the Dordogne area. 

161
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,440
You're halfway through. You've got one-and-a-half hours to go. 

162
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,080
It's all about time management, this. They've got to finish on time. 

163
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,280
If you're creating a pastry tart, you've got to chill that down, 

164
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,520
making a macaroon, you've got to rest that for at least an hour. 

165
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,200
Whichever direction they choose to go, it takes time, 

166
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,800
and they will have to multitask, probably for the first time, 

167
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,520
on several different things. 

168
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,160
- JAMES:
- I made a wee list, 

169
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,280
of the time allotments for each thing that I'm doing. 

170
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,160
And that's totally gone out the window. 

171
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,000
I've got pastry cracking here, it's not going well. 

172
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,400
- DANNY:
- What I've done is I've actually chosen three things where 

173
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,680
I know I can cook them all at the same temperature. 

174
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,640
When it comes to sponge-based petits fours, 

175
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,080
only one baker is attempting 

176
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,520
France's famous shell-shaped classic. 

177
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,200
I'm just doing the Madeleines in this tin, 

178
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,000
just for the original shape. 

179
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,280
But, what I'll do, is I'll drizzle a sticky lemon syrup on top of them, 

180
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,160
and then roll them in caster sugar, so they look bejewelled. 

181
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,320
- Bejewelled.
- Bejewelled.
- I love that. 

182
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,840
They're quite difficult, it's the Genoese sponge method. 

183
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,160
It's the foaming method. So, it's in the flavour, though, isn't it? 

184
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,920
John's lemon Madeleines will be accompanied by 

185
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,400
white chocolate and raspberry tartlets, 

186
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,080
and dark chocolate and cherry macaroons. 

187
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,200
- JOHN:
- Anything could go wrong with this bake. 

188
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,040
I mean, every single element is tricky. 

189
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,400
I want this to be my life, you know what I mean? 

190
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,280
I just want to be able to bake. It's important for me to do well. 

191
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,080
Especially with patisserie, because I want to go to Cordon Bleu, 

192
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,480
and I want to learn, do the Grand Diplome in patisserie. 

193
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,080
So, it's important that I do well, because, otherwise, 

194
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,840
I'll never have a cat in hell's chance of getting there. 

195
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,160
Fab four, you've got an hour to go. An hour left on this. 

196
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,880
Come on! This is taking too long. 

197
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,480
- Bonjour! Allo!
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour. How are you? Ca va. 

198
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,160
- Oui, ca va tres bien, Madame.
- Good. 

199
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,520
You've gone for some sort of ornithological patisserie, here. 

200
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,320
- So, you've got a swan with forewings and neck.
- Would you like to do one? 

201
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,720
I'd love to do one. 

202
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,560
- There you go.
- This is...
- You just put in the elongated bit just about... No. 

203
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,280
- SUE LAUGHS 
- You're like all the teachers. "Do that, do that. But no! Like that!" 

204
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,560
- Let me demonstrate. Look, if you hold it here, it'll be firmer.
- Yes. 

205
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,320
- And go in like so. 
- And gouge into the actual choux? 

206
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,840
- Into the choux, and there you go. 
- Right. Right, OK. 

207
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,600
Just tuck it in. There you go, perfect! 

208
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,000
That was deeply therapeutic. I feel calm. That was lovely! 

209
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,240
With a place in the final at stake, one baker is about to commit 

210
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,280
a potentially disastrous patisserie faux pas. 

211
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,480
Never ever do this. 

212
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,640
Normally any water, if it gets into chocolate, 

213
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,600
will cause it to separate and, coagulate and go all horrible. 

214
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,240
You'll see the magic happening in a minute. 

215
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,160
To create a filling for his hazelnut biscuit and chocolate brownie towers, 

216
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,640
James's latest experiment is to melt chocolate in water 

217
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,800
and cool it rapidly over ice while whisking. 

218
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,040
This makes the water droplets smaller, 

219
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,800
forming a smooth emulsion with the chocolate, 

220
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,280
creating a pure chocolate mousse without the need to add cream or egg white. 

221
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,720
Perfect. 

222
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,560
Bakers, you've got 30 minutes left on the petits fours challenge. 

223
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,320
- 30 minutes left.
- Where am I? Right. 

224
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,600
- GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION 
- It's not very many minutes to go. 

225
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,200
- TIMER BEEPS 
- Oh, no! 

226
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,320
I think another 30 seconds. 

227
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,680
- Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! A lot of shaking. You all right?
- Yeah, yeah. 

228
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,800
I'm always like this. 

229
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,000
It's rustic! 

230
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,920
- Hang on, I've lost a Madeleine. 
- HE GASPS 

231
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,160
I left it in the tin, and it's deflated in the tin. 

232
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,520
But I'll hide that, and no one will tell Paul and Mary about that, will they? 

233
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,200
OK, semifinalists, 

234
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,360
you have five minutes left on your French creations. 

235
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,360
This red mucus... 

236
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,320
Bakers, come on in, your time is up. 

237
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,080
Step away from your goods. Thank you. 

238
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,720
What we do like is originality. 

239
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,160
And I have never heard of that. 

240
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,880
They look so pretty with their little chilli topping. 

241
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,840
Macaroons are chewy. 

242
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,320
The chilli is there, but it's not overpowering at all. 

243
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,160
Let's have the tartlets. 

244
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,920
The pastry is a very, very thin layer. All very crispy. 

245
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,320
The interior's lovely, the flavours are good, the pastry tastes good. 

246
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,240
For me, they are too big. Half size, petits fours. 

247
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,800
That's afternoon tea. 

248
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,960
This is a hazelnut biscuit, a chocolate mousse, topped with a brownie. 

249
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,840
The brownie is excellent, the biscuit is good, and the mousse is excellent. It's quite sharp. 

250
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,960
You're very, very good on your flavours. 

251
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,960
- I like the size of these two. These could be a bit big.
- Right. 

252
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,240
I do like the blackberry. 

253
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,120
I think the peppermint is hot, it's got a bit of heat to it, 

254
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,880
which I don't necessarily agree works with the blackberry. 

255
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,320
It's a shame. 

256
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:15,200
- Nice, even bake.
- Basil works well. 
- Yeah.
- I like the look of that. 

257
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,720
It looks tempting. 

258
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,160
Mmm! Beautifully crisp. 

259
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,600
- Full of flavour. The chocolate goes well.
- I don't like the foot.
- Yeah. 

260
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,320
You need to have more of a clean edge when you're putting your chocolate on. 

261
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,760
The sizes of these are probably a bit too big. 

262
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,800
And also, it somehow or other should have a better appearance. 

263
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,720
It's just a slab on the plate. 

264
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,520
- The flavour's there. 
- Flavour's great.
- Texture's there. 

265
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,840
But the look is terrible. 

266
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,960
Not much of a shine on the top. 

267
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,920
I think I would have liked a lighter chocolate in the middle. 

268
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,880
That's exactly what I was going to say. 

269
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,440
It's like having a piece of great chocolate cake, but you can only have a little bite. 

270
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,680
- Yeah.
- Which is why, if you'd made that even smaller, 

271
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,320
and just popped it in with a lighter chocolate, would have been perfect. 

272
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,440
OK, let's carry on now with the raspberry tartlets. 

273
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,840
I like the sharpness of the raspberry. 

274
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,520
I like the white chocolate. 

275
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,000
But it doesn't really excite me when I eat it. 

276
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,640
That texture between the raspberry and the chocolate... Oh, dear. 

277
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,160
- It just doesn't...
- That mucus? Yeah. 
- You hit this sharpness, and then you get this... 

278
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,480
Oh, the textures are all wrong. 

279
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,320
They look so tempting and so beautiful, 

280
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,280
I feel as though I'm in Paris. 

281
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,120
Good, consistent size. They look very pretty. 

282
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,080
They are beautifully baked, 

283
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,040
and you get the real flavour of the nuts coming through, 

284
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,360
and the pistachio is soft and squidgy. It is a sheer joy to eat. 

285
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,040
- Thank you.
- Wow! 

286
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,680
- Aren't they pretty? 
- The flavour of the lime comes through beautifully, as well, 

287
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,480
that little bit of sharpness to marry up with the sweet. 

288
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,920
The actual core size of it is proper petit four case size, 

289
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,920
- and what you done is made them very elaborate.
- Embellished.
- Yes. 

290
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,080
This is the coffee meringue with the hazelnut cream. 

291
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,080
The flavour is absolutely lovely. 

292
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,920
- Just the right amount of coffee, just the right amount of nut. 
- Very Parisian. 

293
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,560
- Petits fours? You've come the closest to the size.
- Thank you. 

294
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,720
What I'm really, really pleased about was to hear the compliment around how Parisian they looked. 

295
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,760
I couldn't have imagined it going better, really. 

296
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,240
It was never going to be completely perfect, 

297
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,960
but you can't get a tray of petits fours completely perfect, 

298
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,120
even for patissiers, they are quite hard to do. 

299
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,200
I don't think I did too well at all, there, to be honest. 

300
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,760
But you've done now, there's nothing I can do to change that. 

301
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,480
If I let that deter me from doing well in the next two rounds, you know, I'm out of here. 

302
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,520
So, bakers, you know what comes next - the afeared Technical Challenge. 

303
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,920
As per usual, this one is judged blind, 

304
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:28,640
so, Mary, Paul, would you like to hoof off to the marquee d'amour! 

305
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,160
Bakers, I can now reveal to you that we are going to be asking you, please, 

306
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,280
to bake the famous celebration cake, 

307
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,840
which is of course French, and it's called a fraisier. 

308
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,600
"Frasier," in British. 

309
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,920
Now, this has got to be visually stunning, OK? 

310
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,840
It's all about the layers of sponge, strawberry and creme patissiere. 

311
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,800
It's the semifinal, 

312
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,680
so Mary and Paul will be requiring nothing short of perfection. 

313
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,800
- So, on your marks...
- Get set... 

314
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,160
BOTH: Bake! 

315
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,360
The bakers have the same ingredients, the same recipe 

316
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,880
and the same problem. 

317
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,640
Bare. The instructions are bare, this week. Really bare. 

318
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,640
"Make a Genoese sponge." That's all it says on how to make a cake. 

319
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,840
"Make the creme pat." 

320
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,440
I know what one should look like, but I don't actually know 

321
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,400
if I can do it, so let's see. 

322
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,880
Mary, the fraisier cake, I think it's a fantastic technical challenge. 

323
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,520
Can you tell us a little bit about it? 

324
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,480
First of all, you've got to meet a Genoese sponge. 

325
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,000
Now, a Genoese is tricky, as we all know. 

326
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,480
You must have the butter just at the right temperature. 

327
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,120
Too hot, and you lose all the volume. The filling is creme patissiere. 

328
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,360
It's got to hold its shape. If it's too warm, it will just ooze out. 

329
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,120
The whole result is beautiful. 

330
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:55,200
- It looks great, it really does. 
- Well, isn't that absolutely scrummy? 

331
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,320
That's a nice cake, that, Mary. 

332
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,480
Well, it starts with make a Genoese sponge 

333
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,000
and I think I know how to make up a Genoese sponge. 

334
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,520
Genoese sponge is the little black dress of the patisserie world - 

335
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,840
a simple, elegant cake that gets its panache 

336
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,240
from the accessories of flavourings, fillings and toppings which adorn it. 

337
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,440
There is no leavening agent. 

338
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,480
Instead, whole eggs are whisked with sugar over warm water 

339
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,320
to produce light, airy texture. 

340
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,800
Done correctly, they will expand four times the original volume. 

341
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,840
- JOHN:
- Start again with this. I had it too hot and it's cooked the eggs. 

342
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,040
I am flustered. It's just to know that I am in the worst position 

343
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,040
to start this round off with. It's just a bit gutting. 

344
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,840
I'm trying not to let that get to me but it's difficult. 

345
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,960
- DANNY:
- You want to try and do the minimum amount of mixing with a Genoese. 

346
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,080
Because once you've gone to all the trouble of putting the air in, 

347
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,440
the last thing you want to do is ruin it by knocking all the air out. 

348
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,080
You add the flour and then you add in the melted butter. 

349
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,560
It gives you a different texture. 

350
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,000
Once the butter is added, the cake must be baked 

351
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,760
immediately before the foamy batter starts to deflate. 

352
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,800
As our final few bakers pop their creations into the oven, 

353
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,920
they take for granted the fact that technology 

354
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,520
can bring their creations to life. 

355
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,680
It seems beautifully apt that this week, on French week, 

356
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,400
we are celebrating Alexis Soyer who allowed us 

357
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,200
to bring the art of fine baking into the home. 

358
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,560
Alexis Soyer was born in France in 1810 

359
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,960
and displayed culinary prowess from a young age, 

360
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,320
becoming chief cook aged just 16. 

361
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,600
A flamboyant and ambitious character, he travelled 

362
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,400
to London, becoming head chef at the exclusive Reform Club 

363
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,880
where he set about attracting Victorian cooking methods 

364
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,400
into the future. 

365
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,320
Soyer was given carte blanche, here at the Reform Club, 

366
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,160
to create the most modern, technically sophisticated kitchens 

367
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,360
in the entire world 

368
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,920
and he took full advantage of this. 

369
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,200
Pall Mall was the first street in Britain to have 

370
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,400
a regular supply of gas and so he harnessed this 

371
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,440
to install an entire row of gas stoves. 

372
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,800
Ever the showman, Soyer opened his Reform Club kitchens 

373
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,480
to an astonished public, previously suspicious of gas cooking. 

374
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,200
It became the second biggest tourist attraction in London 

375
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,800
after Madame Tussaud's and, buoyed by the success, 

376
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,600
Soyer organised a spectacular new gastronomic exhibition - 

377
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,560
the Universal Symposium Of All Nations. 

378
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,000
Soyer used to the symposium to promote the use of gas. 

379
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,360
Every day he roasted an entire ox by gas 

380
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,080
so everybody could watch this and he had rows of gas stoves that people 

381
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,480
could see the 600 roasts a day that the symposium had to produce 

382
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,680
being roasted in front of their eyes. 

383
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,640
Before this time, people had been really quite frightened of gas 

384
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,560
and he wanted the domestic user 

385
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,200
to understand that gas wasn't dangerous. 

386
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,360
In fact, quite the opposite. It was the most amazing boon 

387
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,960
and could really benefit them in their home environment. 

388
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,400
Soyer's variable temperature gas stove proved to be 

389
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,840
a revelation for the domestic baker and allowed people to experiment 

390
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,720
and become more ambitious with their home bakes. 

391
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,880
Soyer is really the grandfather of the oven in your house. 

392
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,320
The old coal-fired ranges were blunt instruments but Soyer's 

393
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,000
gas temperature controlled ovens were precision tools. 

394
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,800
They had a pilot light on them so you didn't need to open 

395
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,760
the door to check the temperature so your cakes were safe from sinking. 

396
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
The gas oven transforms home baking 

397
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,080
because, instead of just sticking something in at a temperature 

398
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,760
that wouldn't change and then pulling it out again, 

399
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,640
you can change the temperature, you can cook things 

400
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,640
at a very low heat, you can make elaborate pastries and meringues. 

401
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,880
Things that would really have been beyond the repertoire of any 

402
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,200
domestic cook in the days when you had to cook on coal. 

403
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,880
Soyer's oven's were too expensive for working-class Victorians 

404
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,360
but he didn't forget those less fortunate, 

405
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,320
publishing cookery books for the poor and setting up 

406
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,760
soup kitchens to help those starving in the Irish potato famine. 

407
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,080
Soyer's longest-lasting legacy, though, is what he did for the Army. 

408
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,280
During the Crimean War, he invented a kind of stove - 

409
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,960
essentially a camping stove - 

410
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,240
and that meant that two men could cook for 600 people. 

411
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,320
An army marches on its stomach. 

412
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,680
He made sure that they could march in that way. 

413
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,280
And those reforms in the Army stayed in place until the 1980s. 

414
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,440
Since his death in 1858, 

415
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,080
the memory of Soyer's groundbreaking achievements has faded over time. 

416
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,440
But the legacy this dandy Frenchman leaves us 

417
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,720
still stands in our kitchens today. 

418
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,920
OK, bakers, you've got one hour on your fraisier. 

419
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,960
One hour to go on your fraisier. 

420
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,920
Yeah, seems an OK size for the size of the cake. 

421
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,360
It's maybe a wee bit short. 

422
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,280
To create the top and bottom of their finished cake, 

423
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,200
the delicate sponge must be perfectly cut in two. 

424
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,440
Unequal layers will ruin the fraisier's appearance. 

425
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,600
And should the sponge break, the top won't be flat 

426
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,440
and the creme patissiere could seep out through the bottom 

427
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,080
before it's fully set. 

428
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,440
The creme patissiere filling in a fraisier requires 

429
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,760
an unfamiliar addition 

430
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,120
to ensure it's thick enough to support the structure of the cake. 

431
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,320
I've never worked with cornflour in a creme pat before 

432
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,440
so I don't really know how it should be 

433
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,800
other than it's quite lumpy and it doesn't appear to be thickening up. 

434
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,800
Which is slightly worrying me. 

435
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,000
Cornflour only cooks and thickens around boiling point 

436
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,200
and the margin for error is tiny. 

437
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,080
Not cooked enough and it will be runny, causing the cake to collapse. 

438
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,720
Overcooked, it loses its vital silky cream texture. 

439
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,280
- JAMES:
- Never used such a thick creme pat before, ever. 

440
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,480
My creme pat's got cellulite at the moment. It's just... 

441
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,440
It'll be all right. 

442
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,440
Adding the butter is going to make it homogenise and then when it sets 

443
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,480
and cools it will become much more pipeable and therefore cutable. 

444
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,200
If you don't want a skin to form on creme pat, the trick is 

445
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,160
to chuck on a little bit of icing sugar. 

446
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,720
If the wind doesn't blow it away then that'll stop the skin forming. 

447
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,680
While the creme patissiere sets in the fridge, 

448
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,320
the bakers start to assemble the cake. 

449
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,400
First, the tin is lined with acetate. 

450
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,680
This is the first sponge we've asked people to bake 

451
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,760
that actually has its own built-in rain mac. 

452
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,560
We need to do this to make it look pretty somehow. 

453
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,760
If it isn't flush with the edge of the tin, 

454
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,120
the edge of the fraisier won't be smooth. 

455
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,960
- Goodness. I've got no idea how to do this.
- How's Danny doing? 

456
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,120
Danny's on good form. Is she? 

457
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,480
She'll have a good morning and she'll be fine. She'll do this properly. 

458
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,680
I can't do it. 

459
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,560
I think John's a bit stressed. 

460
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,400
How is that rain mac coming on? All right? 

461
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,880
- I can't do it.
- You'll be all right. 

462
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,240
I hate this feeling of, "I may as well give up now." 

463
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,840
But I'm not going to because, you know, 

464
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,720
every bake is another chance to turn it all around, isn't it? 

465
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,480
- He's been in the drop a few times. 
- I know. 

466
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,160
Hm. Semi-final, mate. 

467
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,520
30 minutes, bakers. 30 minutes left. 

468
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,440
You could hear a penny drop. 

469
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,880
Each cake needs to be topped with a layer of marzipan before adding 

470
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,520
the final piped chocolate decoration. 

471
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,160
Don't know the best way of doing it, actually. 

472
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,680
This is, I think, the most technically difficult 

473
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,440
technical so far. 

474
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,360
I've read through the recipe 

475
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,120
and I can't quite visualise it which isn't really a good sign. 

476
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,840
It seems to be heavily based on presentation which makes me fear. 

477
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,760
The chocolate is just setting on me already. 

478
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,080
I should have put it in a bit sooner. 

479
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,600
I was cooling it down to get it to the right temp 

480
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,280
but I think I might have over-cooled it. 

481
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,880
Which is just sod's law, isn't it, you know? 

482
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,800
Oh, hello. That looks really professional. 

483
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,000
Amazeballs. 

484
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,680
OK, bakers, just five minutes 

485
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,120
before we go and get Paul and Mary from their dungeon. 

486
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,960
Just five minutes. 

487
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,040
The moment of truth. Oh! 

488
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,920
Oh, Brendan. 

489
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,160
Might have to go back in the fridge. 

490
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,240
That looks good. It looks amazing. 

491
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,720
This is the unveiling of the century. 

492
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,480
Oh, it's beautiful. Isn't it, Sue? 

493
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,920
Tres bon. 

494
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,840
Looks blooming scrum-diddly-umptious. 

495
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,600
Oh, God above. Just look at that. 

496
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,000
It looks hideous. 

497
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,600
It's just not setting. 

498
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,760
It's just not setting. It's just a disaster. 

499
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,160
OK, bakers. 

500
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,640
Dix, 

501
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,240
neuf, 

502
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,000
huit, 

503
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,040
sept, 

504
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,080
six, 

505
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,600
cinq, 

506
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,360
quatre, 

507
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,360
trois, 

508
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,320
deux, 

509
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,480
un. 

510
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,000
Boulange c'est fini. 

511
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,920
That was a tough challenge, wasn't it? 

512
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,560
One or two of them look pretty good. We'll start with this one, Mary? 

513
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,280
- If we have a look down the middle of this.
- It looks a good Genoese. 

514
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,720
Even distribution of the strawberries, 

515
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,800
the creme patissiere looks firm. 

516
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,560
- Holding well.
- Yes. 

517
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,160
The Genoese looks beautifully even. 

518
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,280
- It's quite a nice one, that one. 
- Very nice presentation. 

519
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,240
That ticks the boxes, as they say. 

520
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,200
Now, this one's had some issues with the creme pat. 

521
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,800
Just take a slice out of here. 

522
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,440
And the volume from the Genoese isn't as good as it should be. 

523
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,040
No, it's dense, isn't it? 

524
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,280
Oh dear. 

525
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,680
Do we need a spoon with this rather than a slice? 

526
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,960
This has got serious problems with the creme pat. 

527
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,320
Serious problems with the creme pat. 

528
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,200
- The sponge looks light though, doesn't it?
- Sponge looks beautiful. 

529
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,960
Very lemony. 

530
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:07,200
- Good Genoese that.
- But the creme patissiere is not thick enough. 

531
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,960
- That's a shame because it actually tastes OK.
- Tastes beautiful. 

532
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,360
Finally, this looks pretty good. 

533
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,840
A nice layer of Genoese, 

534
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,120
well arranged strawberries, 

535
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,680
creme patissiere pushed right in with the strawberries. 

536
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,800
That's good. 

537
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,120
You've got a bit of zing from the lemon. 

538
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,560
Creme pat is good, sponge is good and you've managed to come up 

539
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,200
with something that certainly resembles a fraisier cake. 

540
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,360
But whose fraisier has failed and whose will get full marks? 

541
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,480
That one and that one. 

542
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,040
OK, we've made our decision 

543
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,280
and the person in fourth place is this one. 

544
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,280
Danny, there was a problem with the creme pat, which I think you already knew. 

545
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,640
So, on to the person that is third. 

546
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,040
Little bit soft, just lost its shape, pushed the strawberries out. 

547
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,120
Otherwise, lovely flavour. 

548
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,080
And in second place is this one. It's not bad at all. 

549
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,680
But you look at the two, we have to sort of pick between the two of them 

550
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,760
and that one had more of a rise in the sponge. But it was a good cake. Well done. 

551
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,120
- And there we have number one, James. 
- Well done, James. 

552
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,080
Well done. 

553
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,040
Well done. It was a very, very difficult challenge. 

554
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,680
That was a really, really tough two-and-a-half hours. 

555
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,840
It was a killer technical. But I did it. They liked it. 

556
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,080
Just the sponge wasn't just as good as James. That wily minx! 

557
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,680
Actually that cake is brilliant. I would totally make that cake again. 

558
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:58,120
One of the few technicals I really enjoyed actually. 

559
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,360
I think I feel frustrated, more than anything. 

560
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:05,520
Not angry, not upset, just kind of like, "Oh, you stupid girl!" 

561
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:11,200
Erm... You make mistakes. You make mistakes. I've made two here. 

562
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,400
It's frustrating, it's annoying, but I just have to put that 

563
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,120
out of my head now and concentrate on tomorrow. 

564
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,000
Just the Showstopper Challenge remains. 

565
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,320
The last chance for the bakers to prove they have what it takes to be in the final. 

566
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,000
Brendan's done rather well. 

567
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,520
His petit fours were outstanding, really. 

568
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,920
You looked at it and you thought, "He's arrived." 

569
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,040
And James has done quite well. 

570
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,480
Who do you think the rain cloud of rejection is hanging over this week? 

571
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,920
At the moment, I think you're looking at John and Danny. 

572
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,760
Danny, yesterday afternoon, had a bit of a disaster 

573
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,120
because her cake sort of fell apart. 

574
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,680
This is a real dangerous time to do that. 

575
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,400
If it happened two weeks ago, fair enough, but you don't do it in the semi-final. 

576
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,800
Having said that, I thought John's petit fours were poor. 

577
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,320
This is the last challenge which stands between you 

578
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,920
and a place in the Great British Bake Off Final. 

579
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,800
What we need you to create is a perfect choux pastry gateau. 

580
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,240
- I wish you all the very best of luck. On your marks...
- Get set... 
- Bake. 

581
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,040
Choux pastry forms the basis of many French classics, 

582
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,280
including profiteroles and eclairs. 

583
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,400
It's a cross between a batter and a dough and it's cooked twice. 

584
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,160
First over a low heat on the hob, then in the oven. 

585
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,840
It's that magic that happens when you put it in the oven, 

586
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,480
you go from a very hot mix into as piping bag, onto a tray 

587
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,840
and into an oven and that heat that's transferred into the oven, 

588
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,960
that blast of heat, pumps the air in and explodes the egg. 

589
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,120
That's how you get those irregular shape balls in a great choux pastry. 

590
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,960
They can do exactly what they like, 

591
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,920
but it's got to be mainly choux pastry. 

592
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,400
This is the last chance to get into the final. 

593
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,920
It's got to be something really spectacular 

594
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,000
and all the flavours have to complement each other. 

595
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,120
Danni, Brendan and John are opting to make the Gateau St Honore, 

596
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,800
a puff pastry base with a top ring of choux pastry, 

597
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,680
garnished with cream puffs and filled with a Chiboust cream. 

598
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,360
Danny's adding rosewater, raspberry and lychees to hers. 

599
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,600
Lychees, very difficult to achieve a flavour. 

600
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:53,040
- Your raspberry will come through, I would imagine.
- Yeah. It's more to support the rose really. 

601
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,480
I think it kind of lightens it up a bit and adds to the flavour. 

602
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,160
Seems to me it's got an original twist and that's what we like. 

603
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,320
- I think it's going to work. Let's hope so.
- OK. Thank you. 

604
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,600
I think everyone's going to feel the pressure, 

605
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,920
but I think me personally, obviously, I'm in a precarious position. 

606
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,000
So I need to tread carefully today. 

607
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,920
John's chance of staying in the competition now rests 

608
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,840
on creating a perfect Gateau St Honore. 

609
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,640
He's using his favourite fruit 

610
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,680
to create a distinctive flavour for the filling. 

611
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,600
I'm interested in your passion fruit curd. 

612
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,720
- Has it got lemons in as well as passion fruit?
- No. 

613
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,240
Pure passion fruit. Do you keep the seeds in it? 

614
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,960
No, I blitz it completely in the processor and then sieve it 

615
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,240
really well and just use the pulp, which has been liquidized. 

616
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,280
No seeds. Obviously, that would just be too gritty. I wouldn't want that. 

617
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,360
- You feeling the pressure today? 
- Yeah! 

618
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,560
I'm actually really scared today. 

619
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,960
But it's important to me, so I'm going to calmly do what I can. 

620
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,760
- Very best of luck, John.
- Good luck. 
- I need it. Thank you. 

621
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,920
Less is more is my new motto. I've kept the flavouring to a minimum. 

622
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,600
I think it's one of the great established classics 

623
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:12,200
of the French patisserie and in my view, it doesn't need any help. 

624
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,960
But to personalise it, I'm adding a little kirsch to the French custard. 

625
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,680
And just a little bit of chocolate on the edge. 

626
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,240
But I'm not going to do anything more than that 

627
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,440
because I think it stands alone and I think it's an impertinence 

628
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,400
to tinker with something that's so well established. 

629
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,440
Perfecting a choux is a true baker's art. 

630
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,680
There's no set recipe for the amount of egg to add. 

631
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,680
The slightest difference in the size of eggs used can dramatically 

632
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,440
alter its texture. 

633
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,440
I've added two eggs, I need to add four. 

634
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,680
It still feels a little bit wet. 

635
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,080
The bakers need to watch for the exact moment 

636
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,320
they create a mixture that will pipe and hold its shape. 

637
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,360
A fraction too much egg and their choux will become sloppy 

638
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,560
and won't rise in the oven. 

639
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,840
I'll use this recipe and I'll add five eggs 

640
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,400
and that won't be enough, I'll need to add a sixth, 

641
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,040
but you can easily go overboard with that sixth egg. 

642
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,680
I don't know what the hell I can do cos it's just not working. 

643
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,560
Typically, James is making something a little bit different. 

644
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,960
A Paris-Brest, traditionally a circular gateau 

645
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,600
filled with a praline cream. 

646
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,880
Everyone else has gone for a Gateau St Honore. 

647
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,840
And it's a much more ambitious thing, a much more testing thing, theirs, 

648
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,280
so hopefully they don't mark me down for being a bit too simple. 

649
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,640
The Paris-Brest was created in 1891 to commemorate 

650
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,400
the 1,200km cycle race. 

651
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,640
Although the gateau is usually in the shape of bike wheel, 

652
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,000
James is planning to go further. 

653
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,680
Go right through how you're constructing this. 

654
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,560
I don't know. 

655
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,760
This is a semi-final, James, of the Great British Bake Off. 

656
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,720
I don't quite get the hang of this. 

657
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,000
Turn it upside down, put some wheels on it. 

658
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,480
This is just a concept, so far. 

659
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,800
I may just have a traditional Paris-Brest. 

660
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,160
I like the Tour de France idea, I think it's cool. 

661
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,000
- HE LAUGHS 
- It's going to be a showstopper, if you pull this off. 

662
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,400
Or, if it fails, just say it's a unicycle. 

663
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,640
- Yes! 
- And where are the fillings going? 

664
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,360
Again, I'm not quite sure. 

665
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,960
If I do it as a traditional one... 

666
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,720
HE LAUGHS 

667
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,920
I love it... 

668
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,880
Now you're just getting cheeky! 

669
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,240
This is bare-faced cheek! 

670
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,080
You know your basics of what you'll do, 

671
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,200
- you're just not quite sure... 
- SUE MOUTHS 

672
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,840
- ..How the parts...
- Yes! 
- ..Will come together.
- Exactly. 

673
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,480
I'd like to see a bike. 

674
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,200
I would like to see the whole thing. 

675
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,880
The impact of it would be pretty good. 

676
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,280
I hope you do it all right, 

677
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,560
- and I hope you do it some justice, as well.
- Thank you, Paul. 

678
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:57,120
It's interesting that three of them have chosen Gateau Saint Honore. 

679
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,200
An absolute classic. 

680
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,360
But all but Brendan are doing variations of that. 

681
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,800
And the Paris-Brest? We'll just have to see. 

682
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,520
My problem is... 

683
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,040
when you look at James saying, "I don't really know, I'll just wing it"... 

684
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,880
if that is the case, and he puts up 

685
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,040
a mess in front of us, 

686
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,760
I'm not going to be best pleased. 

687
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,840
Your bicycle has created 

688
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,080
a frisson of excitement. What the hell is that?! 

689
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,600
That's a handlebar. 

690
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,960
Oh, OK. It's like a ram's horn. 

691
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,880
Check it out in the oven. Look how big it's got. 

692
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,920
Surprise, surprise(!) 

693
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,280
Oh, my God! The beast... 

694
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,760
- SHE LAUGHS 
- The flavours will be awesome, though. 

695
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,240
I don't think you should worry. 

696
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,120
If it looks a bit gacky, just don't do it. 

697
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,200
If the worst comes to the worst, you have a couple of perfect breasts. 

698
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,000
Oui. 

699
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,160
Ca c'est OK. 

700
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,520
For Brendan, Danny and John, small choux buns form the centrepiece of their showstopper bakes. 

701
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,560
Any peaks in the paste will burn before the choux is fully cooked, 

702
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,880
so should be flattened down with a damp finger. 

703
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,600
The choux is first cooked at a high temperature, 

704
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,360
forcing the water into steam to make the pastry expand, 

705
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,560
and then, on a lower heat, to allow it to crisp. 

706
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,760
It will be an anxious half hour before the bakers know if they've judged the consistency right. 

707
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,080
Now, three out of four of our bakers 

708
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,760
are producing their own versions of the Saint Honore cake... 

709
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,560
which was inspired by the patron saint of baking. 

710
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,520
A Frenchman with a penchant for baking miracles. 

711
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,320
You sort of gaze at these beautiful pastry works of art. 

712
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,200
It seems inconceivable you'd need a baking miracle to create them. 

713
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,480
But, if you were in need of divine intervention, 

714
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,960
simply send up a prayer to Saint Honore, 

715
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,600
the patron saint of bakers. 

716
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,440
- Merci.
- Au revoir. 

717
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,360
Saint Honore's holy association with baking began when he was made 

718
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:58,240
bishop of the French town of Amiens in the sixth century. 

719
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,520
Why he's connected to bakers is a really interesting issue. 

720
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,520
His old nanny was breaking bread, 

721
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,080
and she was told, 

722
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,480
"Honore is to become bishop," 

723
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,200
and she said, "Nonsense". No way would he agree, 

724
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,080
She took the peel she was using 

725
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,800
to put the breads into the oven, 

726
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,760
and she said, "I'll believe it, 

727
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,080
"if this peel sprouts flowers." 

728
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,040
Which, of course, it miraculously does. 

729
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,480
Flowers, and indeed, blackberry fruits, as well. 

730
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,000
Over the centuries, Saint Honore became a much-worshipped figure. 

731
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,320
His bones prayed to in times of drought to encourage a good harvest, 

732
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:38,000
and, in 1202, a rich baker built a chapel to honour him 

733
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,400
on a street in Paris that became known as Rue Saint Honore. 

734
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,520
Bakers did very well in that period, because Paris is the capital. 

735
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,400
With not only the royal palace, but all the aristocrats 

736
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,960
who come to be in court and spend time in Paris. 

737
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,280
There's tremendous demand, not only for bread, 

738
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,880
but, of course, for fine cakes and patisserie, as well. 

739
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,160
So that street become the hub - the area where shop after shop 

740
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,760
of bakers and fine cake makers find their home. 

741
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,600
One such patissier with a shop on Rue Saint Honore in the 1840s 

742
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,000
was the enigmatic chef, Chiboust, 

743
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,560
and when it came to naming a cake after Saint Honore, 

744
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:18,280
he chose one decadent and complex enough to truly show off the baker's artistry. 

745
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,080
This mouth-watering tribute, 

746
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,640
this offering to the patron saint of pastry 

747
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,000
is still available in all good patisseries. 

748
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,840
Mr Chiboust sounds like 

749
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,360
a Gallic superhero. What's the difference he brought to this cake? 

750
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,320
He wanted to make a new cream, 

751
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,960
something very different from what they were doing at the time. 

752
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,640
Finished the big, eccentric French patisserie - you know, 

753
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,560
the tall, long, uneatable cake. 

754
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,280
So he created this Cream Chiboust, 

755
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,920
same like the name - like his name... 

756
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,400
with egg white and sugar. 

757
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,640
An Italian meringue, as we call it. 

758
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,520
He mixed it with the creme patissier 

759
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,440
to make something very fluffy, something very light. 

760
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,480
Something you could eat all the way through the cake. 

761
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,240
Is there anything particular in the way it's decorated 

762
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,600
that makes this a Saint Honore? 

763
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,240
- Definitely. Piping is one of them. 
- Right. 

764
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,720
You need that special nozzle. The V-shaped nozzle. 

765
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,400
Basically, it gives a kind of a flowery effect. 

766
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,680
A leafy effect. 

767
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,880
- Right.
- Very traditional for Saint Honore. 

768
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,880
- It must be that shape. 
- That's the Chiboust classic, right. 

769
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,600
Watch me make a right pig's ear of that. 

770
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,000
I need to pray to the patron saint of steady hands. 

771
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,880
Saint Judder. 

772
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,920
- Shall I start here?
- Yes. 

773
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,720
Remember, the tip of the nozzle must be always right. 

774
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,400
A little bit sideways. 

775
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,920
That's right. You must face that little point. 

776
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,080
Oh, dear! I've made a right mess of that. 

777
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,520
It takes time and discipline. 

778
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,560
I've brought shame on your country. 

779
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,760
That's OK. I will finish it off. 

780
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,720
- Thank you. Now you're just showing off, Eric.
- A little bit. 

781
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,080
Yeah, a little bit. 

782
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,240
For Anglo-French relationships, it's good I let him take over. 

783
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,320
- Entente Cordiale.
- Oui! 

784
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:04,160
Chiboust's traditional Saint Honore would simply have been flavoured with rose water or violet, 

785
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,880
but a modern flourish is to garnish the cake with fresh fruits and berries. 

786
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,480
So, the Honore - a rich, indulgent delight 

787
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,440
that's worthy of the patron saint of baking, after whom it's named. 

788
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,880
If your croquembouche is staring to sag, 

789
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,680
why not send up a prayer for divine intervention? 

790
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,760
maybe a baking miracle could be yours. 

791
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,720
That is lovely! 

792
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,680
Bakers, you're halfway through. One-and-a-half hours to go. 

793
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,520
The choux should have tripled in size to form perfectly puffy, rounded buns. 

794
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,600
Happy with those? 

795
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,160
They should have risen more in a round, rather than a flat. 

796
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,080
You all right, James? 

797
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,920
- Breathe.
- Don't be nice - I'll start crying. 

798
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,160
It's all right. Has something actually...gone...wrong? 

799
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,440
Yeah, the choux buns aren't as they should be. 

800
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,040
They haven't risen. 

801
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,080
There's nothing I can do. 

802
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,560
Everything's gone to pot. 

803
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,240
Which just... 

804
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:13,080
They shouldn't look so...deformed. 

805
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,360
This is semi-finalitis, mate. 

806
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,280
- Just calm down a bit. Yeah?
- Yeah. 

807
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:22,360
- It's all right, you'll be fine. 
- Thanks for that, Mel. 

808
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,480
It's not collapsed, which is good. 

809
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,880
It's a nice, dark colour, which is good. 

810
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,960
Happy. 

811
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,840
As their choux cools, the bakers need to move on their fillings. 

812
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,440
None of them are making the traditional Saint Honore Chiboust cream. 

813
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:42,880
I'm making creme patisserie, which is like revisiting the scene of a crime, after yesterday! 

814
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,440
SHE LAUGHS 

815
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,000
I want to get it right, and that's important to me, 

816
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,120
because I know I can make this, and I can make this really well. 

817
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,440
James is planning a decadent inner tube - 

818
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,160
an Italian meringue with a rich coffee buttercream, 

819
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,760
but he's decided to make a topping for his filling. 

820
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,360
This is ground-up, caramelised hazelnuts, 

821
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,200
with a shot of espresso in it. 

822
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,240
They are the most adorned wheels in history. 

823
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,520
Bespoke spokes. 

824
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,840
HE LAUGHS 

825
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,880
- Have you tried to put on the frame yet?
- No.
- Right. 

826
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,440
- I'm not going to touch that.
- Yes, you better not touch those. 

827
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,440
I sense that would not be a good idea. 

828
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,480
'Once the choux buns for the Saint Honore are filled, 

829
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,920
'they're caramelised and bound to the pastry.' 

830
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,400
It's like a Scud missile going off, isn't it? 

831
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,000
Bakers! Time for a hot choux shuffle, 

832
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,480
cos you've just got ten minutes left. 

833
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,800
That's it - that's this bake over and done with. 

834
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,000
Step away. James, get off the bicycle. Off! 

835
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,760
Mm-hm! 

836
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:20,280
For one of these bakers, it will be the last time they face the judges. 

837
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,960
OK, Brendan - you're up to the offering to Saint Honore. 

838
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,480
It certainly looks different. It looks striking, 

839
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,520
with the chocolate on top. Quite unusual. 

840
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,040
You have a good rise in the pastry there. 

841
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,320
Done an exceptional job on the display of it. 

842
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,600
I think it looks really good. 

843
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:48,280
Quite a tough crunch through the top of the bun. 

844
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,160
But the flavours go well together. 

845
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,680
It's a beautiful thing. Brendan, you've done it again. 

846
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,840
Your theme-ing and decoration has always been one of your strong points. 

847
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,760
You've got a lovely crust on the bottom - you have beautiful colour. 

848
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,720
But, overall... 

849
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,920
you've done well. 

850
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,000
- Well done.
- Well done, Brendan. 

851
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,360
Danny, if you'd like to bring your choux gateau up, thank you. 

852
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,680
I think it looks quite effective. It's decorated well. 

853
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,160
I thought you were brave picking rose... 

854
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,560
Yeah. 

855
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,520
..cos it can overwhelm. 

856
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,080
Pop that back on there. 

857
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,160
It's very full of rose water. 

858
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:35,520
You've got it in the cream and in the custard. 

859
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,000
Rose water just sweeps over the whole thing. 

860
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,160
The actual bake of it is good. It has a great base. 

861
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,920
But that flavour... 

862
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,360
- Mm.
- ..Has let you down.
- OK. 

863
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,840
SHE LAUGHS 

864
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,320
James, do you want to pedal on over here? 

865
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,880
THEY LAUGH 

866
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,400
I think it's really unusual. 

867
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,360
And, certainly, you've been inventive. 

868
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,640
- Let's have a look.
- It's about to sustain a puncture. 

869
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,320
Right. 

870
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,160
That is absolutely lovely. 

871
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,080
You've got the toffee, the creme patissiere, nuts, caramel... 

872
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,960
It's absolutely delicious, isn't it? 

873
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,080
- All the way through.
- Lovely. 
- You get a little bit of everything. 

874
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,520
- I think you could have got a lot more volume...
- OK. 

875
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,920
..from your choux pastry. You can see where it's starting. 

876
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,720
It hasn't gone to its full explosion, 

877
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,880
which is a shame, but the flavours are good. 

878
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,640
The idea is excellent, 

879
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,920
- but I was expecting more balloon...
- OK. 

880
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,920
- ..from the choux pastry. 
- Thank you. 

881
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,760
- It's the nicest bike I've ever eaten.
- Thank you, Sue.
- Thank you. 

882
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,440
John, if you'd like to bring up your French delight... 

883
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,320
I think it looks the part. 

884
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,880
It looks special. I like the way you've given it 

885
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,880
the height with the hearts. 

886
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,920
Tricky to get off the paper. 

887
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,600
It looks very neat, very professional. 

888
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,240
The fruit round the outside and the piping inside looks good. 

889
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,720
I must say, that is a lovely flavour. 

890
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,440
The passion fruit works really well, 

891
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,120
and you have a nice crisp to that base. 

892
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,880
It's a good choux pastry. 

893
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,320
It's thin, it's crispy. It's full. 

894
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:39,160
- I think you've done well. 
- That means a lot, thank you. 

895
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,040
I'm really pleased at how well that went. 

896
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,600
Don't necessarily know if it's saved me. 

897
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,840
I think it's still very, very dangerous. 

898
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,560
I've had a few very poor weeks. 

899
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,440
It's a shame they picked up on flavours, 

900
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,640
cos that's generally what I've tended to do... well. 

901
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,320
But, erm... 

902
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,080
it really is just one of those things. 

903
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,000
For me, this is probably it now. 

904
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,080
I feel certainly I've done enough to go through to the final, 

905
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,120
which has been my ambition and aim, right from the very start. 

906
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,960
The whole winging-it strategy... 

907
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,960
paid off this time. 

908
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,160
Wow! 

909
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,320
HE LAUGHS 

910
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,320
I didn't expect it. 

911
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:29,240
Paul and Mary must now decide who will go to the final as Star Baker, 

912
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,640
and who won't be going at all. 

913
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:35,680
So who might be in line for Star Baker this week, then? 

914
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,400
I put James up there. 

915
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,040
Obviously came first in the Technical Challenge, 

916
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,240
and some of his petits fours were pretty tasty. 

917
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:46,280
Again, Brendan seems to pull the stops out each day. 

918
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,080
The unstoppable Brendanator. 

919
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,760
Going into this, John and Danny were both in trouble... 

920
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,880
The bake from Danny was all right. I think it was slightly overdone. 

921
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,880
That rose water was the killer in that. 

922
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,640
Lychee was going to lose every single time 

923
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,880
against the rose water, because it is so strong. 

924
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,360
Didn't John raise his game, and come up? 

925
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,160
I think he had such a lovely finish. 

926
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,680
Tricky to do, those hearts in caramel. Lovely flavours, too. 

927
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,560
I agree with Mary. The taste of that was the best one, for me, of the day. 

928
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,640
But he hasn't been on top form. 

929
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,640
His petits fours weren't good. 

930
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,040
Clumsy. 

931
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,440
So, you've still two people in contention for the drop? 

932
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,280
Yeah, I think there's still two. 

933
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,240
Well, Paul and Mary, as always... 

934
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,600
the task falls on you to decide. Good luck. 

935
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,800
BIRDS COO 

936
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,720
Bakers, long, tough weekend 

937
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,840
but you have surpassed yourselves. The standard gets higher and higher. 

938
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:00,280
This week, we are awarding Star Baker... 

939
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:04,440
and we are awarding it to someone who's shown they can produce 

940
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,240
spicy macaroons, very, very perky fraisier, 

941
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,600
but more importantly than all of this, 

942
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,080
the world's most delicious handlebar. 

943
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,360
Congratulations, James. 

944
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,520
THEY APPLAUD 

945
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:22,040
Now, all four of you know how the Bake Off works. 

946
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,120
This is the semi-final. 

947
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:29,840
We can only take three of you with us into next week's final. 

948
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:33,280
I'm afraid the person who will not be joining us next week 

949
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,800
for the Great British Bake Off Final is... 

950
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,800
..Danny. 

951
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:53,640
- Sorry to see you go, Danny. 
- It's absolutely fine. I knew it. 

952
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,240
- MARY:
- How sad it was that Danny left. 

953
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:00,960
She did some excellent baking en route, but on this day, 

954
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,520
the semi-final, it didn't quite work out for her. 

955
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,960
This has pushed me 

956
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:10,760
as far as anything can push me and it's been a good experience. 

957
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,800
One of the nicest things about Bake Off for me is the number 

958
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,400
of people around me who have really taken pleasure from my success. 

959
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,600
I now know how much the people around me value me 

960
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,400
and I think that's pretty cool. 

961
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,440
I'm proud of the fact that I managed to steer my ship through this 

962
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,720
very strange environment to get to the final. 

963
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:41,520
I don't know how I feel right now. But it seems that went rather well. 

964
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,840
- 'Hello.'
- Hiya, Mum. It's only me. 
- 'Hi, darling.' 

965
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:52,400
- You've got a little big boy who's in the final!
- 'Oh, my God!' 

966
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,200
Next time, it's the final. 

967
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,600
- They've got this one chance.
- Every aspect of baking will be tested... 

968
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,480
- Nerves are going to play a huge part in this.
- This might be one step... 

969
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,440
- a little bit too far. 
- ..with signature pastry perfection. 

970
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,400
You've got a bit of a soggy bottom. 

971
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,640
The most intricate technical challenge ever devised. 

972
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,080
The rest won't be as messy. 

973
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,240
- And the showstopper... 
- It goes down to the last challenge. 

974
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,480
This is so tense! '..fit for a British summer fete.' 

975
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,520
It's rich, it's absolutely lovely. 

976
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,640
But after two final days of baking... 

977
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,920
Sorry about this. 

978
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,080
..only one will be crowned the winner... 

979
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,240
He let us down. 

980
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,240
'..of the Great British Bake Off.' The winner is... 

981
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:57,120
