00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,800
Now, I'm on my tod this week as Mel's having the electronic bracelet refitted to her ankle, 

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,360
but behind me are nine of the country's best amateur bakers 

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,080
battling it out over pies, pastries and puddings. 

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,040
Well, each week we get closer to finding our champion 

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,240
and each week I get closer to having to wear a surgical truss. 

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,640
Welcome to the Great British Bake Off. 

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,320
'Last week, the bakers took on pastry...' 

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,520
Let's try that again. 

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,520
'..as the bakers produced a multitude of tarts...' 

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,800
Puff the Magic Pastry, here it comes. 

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,080
'..and James' pastry perfection...' 

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,040
I love that. 

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,080
'..earned him the title of star baker. 

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,480
'But, after some disastrous experiments with flavour...' 

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,280
That doesn't work for me. 

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,440
'..it was Victoria who said goodbye to the Bake Off tent. 

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,840
'This week, dessert is on the menu...' 

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,920
It's leaning that way. 

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,160
I'm going to booze it up and get Mary a bit sloshed. 

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,840
'..but who will appeal to the judges' sweet tooth...' 

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,040
That is absolutely delicious. 

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,200
'..and who will have to hang up their apron for the last time?' 

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,080
It looks like a chocolate breezeblock. 

24
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,640
- My worst nightmare, this is. 
- Bleurgh. 

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,720
I could cry. 

26
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,440
This week, it's all about desserts, 

27
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,160
so expect more meringues than a Katie Price wedding. 

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,080
But less fighting. 

29
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,560
Morning, bakers, and welcome to the first challenge of the weekend - the signature bake. 

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,120
Now, what we're asking you to do for this is to make a torte cake, 

31
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,360
which is, of course, a dessert which consists of multiple layers 

32
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,120
which you can fill with jam or cream or mousse or whatever you like. 

33
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,880
This torte needs to be more than 20cm in diameter. 

34
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,080
You've got three hours to complete this challenge. 

35
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,840
On your marks, get set, bake. 

36
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,760
When making a torte, it's got to look special. 

37
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,480
Not only from the outside, 

38
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,360
it's got to look good as you cut that wedge out. 

39
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,400
It would be nice if it had layers of different flavours, 

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,960
but they've all got to complement each other. 

41
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,240
Just like a classic sponge, a torte mix uses butter, sugar and eggs. 

42
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,480
But that's where the similarities end. 

43
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,840
It can be made with anything except normal conventional wheat flour 

44
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,440
so they could use chestnut flour... Ground almonds will probably be quite prevalent. 

45
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,040
This decision is crucial. 

46
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,440
- HE SIGHS 
- I'm dreading this. 

47
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,000
The choice of flour substitute 

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,160
will have a huge impact on flavour and structure. 

49
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,480
I'm adding hazelnuts and almonds, roasted. 

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,040
Ground nuts, the choice of most bakers, 

51
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,280
will give the torte a firm foundation, 

52
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,880
but can produce a heavy texture... 

53
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,040
I have practised this recipe quite a lot of times. 

54
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,800
..a risk that Danny thinks she has a unique way of avoiding. 

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,520
I'm making a Savoy sponge, which is a fatless sponge 

56
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,960
and I'm using potato flour to hold it together. 

57
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,280
Drawing from her archive of recipes, 

58
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,240
intensive care consultant Danny is always looking to impress 

59
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,000
Paul and Mary with unfamiliar ingredients and tastes. 

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,520
Today she's flavouring her potato flour torte 

61
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,800
with blackberry, white chocolate, lemon and elderflower. 

62
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,040
Now, potato flour. I don't know very much about potato flour. 

63
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,320
- Paul, what can we expect from that? 
- No idea. Never used it. 

64
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,040
- It's very starchy.
- It is. 
- I tend to avoid it like the plague. 

65
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,520
I've used it for drop scones and things like that, 

66
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,480
- but I haven't used it very much. 
- This is going to be fascinating. 

67
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,320
It's very different. And quite tricky. 

68
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,520
My brain is saying it's jammy jacket potatoes. 

69
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,200
Tell me if you think it's still jammy jacket potato. 

70
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,920
If it's you doing it, it won't be jammy jacket potato. 

71
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,440
'Danny isn't the only baker with a unique base ingredient.' 

72
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,240
Chestnut flour is quite pasty, 

73
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,440
but it has a lovely, unique flavour. 

74
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,040
It's trickier working with non-standard flours, 

75
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,760
but I have a number of friends who are gluten intolerant 

76
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,560
so over the last few years I've developed a skill 

77
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,280
of delivering good bakes, basically, without the standard flour. 

78
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,440
At home, it's Brendan's neighbours 

79
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,960
who've benefited from his constant practising, which has paid off 

80
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,080
with a growing reputation for precision and lavish decoration. 

81
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,400
Enjoy. Bye. 

82
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,880
Today he's using clementines and lemon verbena leaves 

83
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,040
to complement the flavour of his chestnut flour. 

84
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,880
I have a tendency to over-elaborate the presentation, 

85
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,120
although I like that if you have the material. 

86
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,440
However, it puts me under pressure for time and so forth, 

87
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,280
so I've taken that on board to rein myself in a little bit, really. 

88
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,920
While Sarah-Jane is using a standard ground almond base 

89
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,880
for her sponge mix... 

90
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,520
..mix the chocolate together in a heat-proof bowl... 

91
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,560
..she's taking a gamble by adding another ingredient 

92
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,400
to boost flavour and structure. 

93
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,000
These amaretti biscuits are mine and my husband's 

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,320
dream pudding ingredient, really. 

95
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,080
This is probably the... I wouldn't say this is outrageous - 

96
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,760
this is the bravest thing I've ever done. 

97
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,600
But until this, getting here on the train by myself 

98
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,680
was the bravest thing I'd ever done. 

99
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,560
Stay-at-home mum Sarah-Jane 

100
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,000
has steadily grown in confidence throughout the Bake Off 

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,440
and her simple but perfectly executed bakes have so far impressed the judges. 

102
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,360
She's going for a chocolate and almond truffle torte 

103
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,040
with plenty of almond liqueur. 

104
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,160
Normally, if I wasn't here on Saturday, 

105
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,880
I'd be washing school uniform, 

106
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,600
getting homework done, so this is totally different. 

107
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,840
I feel quite guilty about having so much fun 

108
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,840
while everybody else is at home doing all the normal stuff. 

109
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,320
To avoid a stodgy torte, 

110
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,880
the bakers whisk egg whites into soft peaks and add them to the batter. 

111
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,440
But it's a delicate operation. 

112
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,840
Beat the egg in too hard and they'll knock all the air out 

113
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,640
and lose the only raising agent in the cake. 

114
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,960
I'm just trying to relax as much as I can 

115
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,400
cos I think when I panic that's when it, kind of, goes wrong for me. 

116
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,360
Before entering the Bake Off, 

117
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,000
Stuart's biggest baking triumph was making his own wedding cake. 

118
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,360
But in the competition, he hasn't always managed to impress. 

119
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
He's hoping to revive his fortunes 

120
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,360
with a Black Forest torte featuring seven layers, 

121
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,400
including milk chocolate ganache, cherry jelly and a mirror glaze. 

122
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,760
Now, you're using layers - is this because you know now 

123
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,200
that layers are your saving grace in this competition? 

124
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,520
Yeah, I suppose, a little bit. 

125
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,040
But also because it allows the different flavours 

126
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,680
to come through as you are, kind of, biting into it. 

127
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,240
It's going to be open-sided, 

128
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,760
so you can actually see all the layers straightaway. 

129
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,360
- That's tricky. 
- I hope you pull it off, mate. 

130
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,960
Yeah, cheers, thank you. 

131
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,000
Cheers. 

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,120
Stuart's thin layers are risky. 

133
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,560
Most bakers will be slicing larger sponges once baked. 

134
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,520
I'm just putting the last little bit in. 

135
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,160
By baking his individually, Stuart's hoping to be able to control 

136
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,800
the consistency of each layer and drastically reduce baking time, 

137
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,600
giving him longer to perfect the finish on his torte. 

138
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,240
If it doesn't rise, it'll be like a pancake. 

139
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,640
And he's not the only one. 

140
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,200
This recipe I just whipped up this week 

141
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,560
so it's all still experimental, 

142
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,000
so it would be nice to go in to bake, you know, 100% confident, 

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,720
but sometimes you just have to take risks. 

144
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,960
Photographer Ryan likes recipes 

145
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,960
which fuse the British baking classics with his Asian heritage. 

146
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,960
His opera torte features almond and hazelnut sponge 

147
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,600
flavoured with green tea, 

148
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,120
which is filled with a dark chocolate ganache and covered with buttercream. 

149
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,240
Once again, flavoured and coloured with green tea. 

150
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,400
I actually looked on the internet and found something quite impressive 

151
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,680
done by a Japanese patisserie in Paris 

152
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,440
and I thought I would recreate that. It's unusual flavours. 

153
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,200
I should have just stuck with the torte. 

154
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,240
OK, bakers - that's half-time. 90 minutes. 

155
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,680
'Baking flourless cakes is a delicate process.' 

156
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,520
Oh, dear. OK. That's one big thing out of the way. 

157
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,840
For those using larger sponges... 

158
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,600
I'm just going to check it. Just make sure. 

159
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,480
..they'll have to judge precisely when it is firm enough to slice, 

160
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,120
but still moist. 

161
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,680
And for Ryan and Stuart's incredibly thin individual layers... 

162
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,400
..the margin for error can be less than a minute. 

163
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,120
Should be all right. 

164
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,120
But sometimes I can't tell how thick they are until I cut into them, 

165
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,640
so it may be sometimes a bit too thin and if it's very thin 

166
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,880
it's hard to handle afterwards, but we won't know until we cut into it. 

167
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,400
It looks generally OK at the minute. 

168
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,360
While their sponges are in the oven, 

169
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,000
the bakers need to make their fillings and toppings. 

170
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,880
There will be the clementines, which are just citrus. 

171
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,160
I'm then going to put lemon oil into the buttercream. 

172
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,200
I've got some blackberries here with some orange juice and zest 

173
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,760
and I'm just going to gently cook them down. 

174
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,880
I'm actually going to make a blackberry curd, 

175
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,040
so I want them to go mushy. 

176
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,120
So just reducing cherries down with a bit of sugar 

177
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,040
and then adding some gelatine into it 

178
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,480
and then just setting it in a square, cherry, jelly layer. 

179
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,160
I only did it the first time this week 

180
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,200
so I'll have to make sure it's perfect, really. 

181
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,760
Nearly all the bakers 

182
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,320
are including a chocolate ganache in their signature tortes. 

183
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,440
I'm always tempted to eat the chocolate while I'm cooking. 

184
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,680
It's a carefully combined mixture of chocolate and fresh cream. 

185
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,440
To avoid making the chocolate seize 

186
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,720
you've got to just use the cream as the melting agent in it. 

187
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,000
You get the cream scorching, pour it over 

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,080
and that should melt the chocolate. 

189
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,520
- ALARM BEEPS 
- I just need to get my thing out of the oven, actually, so... 

190
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,920
Still a bit longer. 

191
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,640
It makes a gentle, like, a bubbling sound if it's not done 

192
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,400
because there's still a bit of moisture in there. 

193
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,240
That's what that moisture sound is, 

194
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,880
so if it sings to you then it's not quite ready, 

195
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,000
so I'm going to put it in for another two minutes. 

196
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,800
What the hell, I'll put it in for four, eh? Back to the chocolate. 

197
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,440
Law student John's love of French patisserie 

198
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,400
is his inspiration when devising new recipes. 

199
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,200
But will his torte noir, flavoured with blackberries, raspberries 

200
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,920
and a hidden layer of tempered chocolate have that French finesse? 

201
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,640
My cream was actually too hot. 

202
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,520
Just a bit too hot and it's seized the chocolate. 

203
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,600
You can see, like...the chocolate splits away from itself 

204
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,560
and all the sugar crystals in the chocolate fly around. 

205
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm going to have to start again. 

206
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,600
What do you want from me? 

207
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,680
Medical student James is the only baker making a flavoured ganache. 

208
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,360
Of all the things that I fed my friends for Bake Off, 

209
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,680
this is the most well received, actually. 

210
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,920
In an attempt to ensure the passion fruit flavour isn't lost, 

211
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,680
he's added it to the cream and infused it. 

212
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,080
- It changes colour a little bit. 
- Before mixing with the chocolate. 

213
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,240
The amount of fresh passion fruit in this means that, you know, 

214
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,840
it's quite an expensive bake. 

215
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,480
It's not a student's everyday diet. Special occasions. 

216
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,360
James's experiments with flavour and technique 

217
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,640
have earned him praise at home and in the Bake Off. 

218
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,360
He's used ground hazelnuts in his chocolate torte, 

219
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,040
and will be using some of his passion fruit ganache 

220
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,440
to create decorative truffles dusted with cocoa powder. 

221
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,400
Oh! I'm getting passion fruit. I wasn't expecting that. 

222
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,040
- That's nice, isn't it?
- You're such a clever thing, you are. 

223
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,760
Clever and cosy. You're the only person who's bothered to think about 

224
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,720
what they might wear in inclement weather. 

225
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,200
I like a man who dresses appropriately. 

226
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,880
John, basically, is stripped to the waist, Stuart's in Hawaiian gear. 

227
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,280
If it's sunny next week, John's style - 

228
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,600
I think I'll copy that for next week. 

229
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,960
- So you'll get the full Shetland rug out next week?
- Yeah. 

230
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,120
'One hour remaining.' 

231
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,800
I'm happy with that, I'm going to take it out. 

232
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,160
Apparently, if you take the ring off as soon as it comes out the oven, 

233
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,560
there's less chance that it will completely implode on itself. 

234
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,280
While some bakers will have to accurately cut their layers 

235
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,120
- from a single sponge...
- Perfect. 

236
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,520
..Ryan's second batch of individually baked layers need to match the first. 

237
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,600
The sponges didn't turn out right 

238
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,160
and so I'll have to rework these now. 

239
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,800
Of all the things that can go wrong, 

240
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,400
this is the worst part because on the others, I can recover. 

241
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,200
I'm not sure if I can make it but I'll have to keep on going. 

242
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,120
Layering a torte requires careful planning. 

243
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,600
You have to think about, when you're cutting into the cake, 

244
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,080
once you get the slice, it should cut through 

245
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,640
without being intercepted by a segment because each gap will be a slice. 

246
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,760
Every sponge, ganache, jelly or cream 

247
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,160
should be perfectly level and clearly separated. 

248
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,520
Just using the scraps of the torte sponge to make the final layer 

249
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,200
because this is going to be the very bottom. 

250
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,320
But Ryan is rapidly running out of time to assemble his torte. 

251
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,800
I don't have time to do another one. 

252
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,000
If it's dry, I'm going to booze it up and get Mary a bit sloshed 

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,360
and hope she won't notice. 

254
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,640
I keep hearing the word "layers," and mine hasn't got layers. 

255
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,680
Well, it's just one-two. 

256
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,560
Cathryn dropped out of college when she was young 

257
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,840
to have her children, Maisie and Ambrose. 

258
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,080
She now wants to prove to all her family that she can be 

259
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,840
a success outside the home as well. 

260
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,680
- Your cake is amazing, Mum. 
- Thanks, hon. 

261
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,640
Her ground macadamia nut and coffee torte 

262
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,800
will have a feathered white chocolate topping and a decorative finish 

263
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,280
she hopes will impress. 

264
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,640
It's a transfer sheet and it's got a picture on it in cocoa butter 

265
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,040
and then you spread the melted chocolate on, and then when it sets 

266
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,880
you peel it away and it should lift up the picture of what's underneath. 

267
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,480
I think I've just not given myself a hectic amount to do 

268
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,560
and so I'm not rushing for time. 

269
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,360
I do feel a bit calmer today which is really good. 

270
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,240
Cathryn isn't the only baker planning a spectacular topping. 

271
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,120
I'm using chocolate icing because the cake itself, 

272
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,160
it's got 70% cocoa, so they're a tiny bit bitter. 

273
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,000
Using icing sugar will boost it up with a bit of sweetness. 

274
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,400
Nursery teacher Manisha has proven to be a consistent baker, 

275
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,440
but each week of the competition has demanded more practice at home 

276
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,760
and more tastings with her dad and brothers. 

277
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,800
How often do cakes last in this house? 

278
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,800
Her ground almond and hazelnut chocolate torte will be filled 

279
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,520
with a mascarpone and kirsch cream 

280
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,800
and a jam made from kirsch-soaked morello cherries. 

281
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,440
- Are these going spare?
- They are going spare.
- Not any longer, they're not. 

282
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,400
- Have you tested this on your brothers?
- Yes. 

283
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,720
- It's too chocolatey, I think, for them, they'd say.
- Really?
- I like it. 

284
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,800
So you make loads of chocolatey things for two brothers who don't really like chocolate? 

285
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,520
But I like chocolate so it's fine. I eat all the chocolate. 

286
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,360
OK, so you make things that they won't like but you can finish off? 

287
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,240
- Yeah.
- No flies on you, that's very clever. 

288
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,880
- OK, bakers, that's three minutes. Just three minutes left.
- Not good. 

289
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:39,600
Not got a lot of time to spare now. Where's that spoon? 

290
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,320
It's split again. 

291
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,160
Could be the end of the road for me, I think. 

292
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,240
Everyone else has done a really marvellous job 

293
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,360
and I'm here looking like an idiot, to be honest. 

294
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,360
It'll have to do. 

295
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,200
How am I going to do this? 

296
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,800
Hasn't set. 

297
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,800
That's how it should look. 

298
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,640
I'm going to have to work this chest for Mary 

299
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,600
because she's not going to be impressed by my torte, I tell you that. 

300
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,640
How do you spell "noir"? N-O-I-R. 

301
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,280
It doesn't say anything, does it? 

302
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,760
Time up, bakers. Get them shiny tortes to the end of your benches 

303
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,760
so that judging can commence, thank you. 

304
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,160
I could cry. 

305
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,160
It's judgement time. 

306
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,080
I actually quite like the look of it. 

307
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,840
The thing is, it's all about textures, 

308
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,600
and flavours, obviously, but it's about textures. 

309
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,320
You really should see the layers 

310
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,360
and you can see your layers very clearly. 

311
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,680
I think it looks very unusual but the one flavour 

312
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,640
that's coming through very strongly is bitter chocolate. 

313
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,720
White chocolate probably would have been better, 

314
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,560
to give you that sweetness to balance with the bitterness coming from the top. 

315
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:42,040
- Cuts well.
- Every slice should look well finished and good on the plate. 

316
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,840
Just how that looks is lovely. 

317
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,320
It's a beautiful cake, nuts are a great texture, and you do get 

318
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,160
that after-palate of the passion fruit which for me is fascinating. 

319
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,440
It looks professional, it's a lovely texture, it's just what I like. 

320
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,280
The piping's very good. It's consistent. 

321
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,400
OK, let's cut into this. 

322
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,200
- Look at that.
- You clever girl, that does look good. 

323
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,640
That's an impressive layers. 

324
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,560
That is... That's quite something. 

325
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,920
That is absolutely delicious. 

326
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,000
It just reminds me of those '70s cakes. 

327
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,600
It's Technicolor! It's great, it's beautiful. 

328
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,000
Oh, it sits up nicely. 

329
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,840
- You've got a decent bake with that chestnut flour.
- Thank you. 

330
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,200
Quite tricky to do. 

331
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,800
- I think it works.
- I think it does. 

332
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,560
I was all ready to say there's too much chestnut sponge, 

333
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,960
and I think it's very, very pleasing. 

334
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,520
I think you've done a good job there 

335
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,120
but keep away from the '70s decoration. 

336
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,200
I think it's like a flourless antidepressant. It's cheered me right up. 

337
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,040
I love the finish you've got on it. 

338
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,600
The actual chocolate mixture is a little bit dry. 

339
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,960
The alcohol that's in there, it's too much. 

340
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,160
It can overwhelm absolutely everything. 

341
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,720
- It's become almost Black Forest. 
- But the whole finish looks lovely. 

342
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,800
Thank you. 

343
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,200
It's... 

344
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,560
The problem is, when you have a chocolate torte like that 

345
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,160
with ground almonds, they will try and dry the thing up. 

346
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,840
Essentially it's quite a dry meal you're putting in there. 

347
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,280
- I'd quite like a little cream with it.
- OK. 

348
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,560
It's a good flavour. 

349
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,200
It's a great flavour but for me, the texture's wrong. 

350
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,480
It's just a bit too dry. 

351
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,480
It's a nice idea. It's simple and effective. 

352
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,280
I like the feathering as well. Feathering's very good. 

353
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,120
- Gosh, that sponge looks good. It does.
- Very rich in colour. 

354
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm coming across the macadamia nut. 

355
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,800
- It's beautifully moist. 
- That is gorgeous. 

356
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,000
Subtle flavours between the nut and the coffee 

357
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,520
- in a nice sponge and well decorated. 
- Thank you. 

358
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,520
- You haven't got the finish. 
- I know, I know. 

359
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,120
- It looks...
- ..messy. 
- A mess. 

360
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,480
I think the flavours are good, the textures are good. 

361
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,160
It just doesn't look professional, but you see, it's lovely, 

362
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,360
the fruit and the cream and the sponge. 

363
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,680
That's absolutely fine, but it's just not cutting right 

364
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,000
- and it's looking a little bit untidy.
- On the plus side, 

365
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,840
it's got more layers than an archaeological dig, so all good. 

366
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,920
I think it looks a bit of a mess, 

367
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,520
it looks like a chocolate breezeblock. You didn't have to make it that big. 

368
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,040
Being so tall, it is very difficult to cut into elegant pieces. 

369
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,240
But that is why I called it noir, in my defence. 

370
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,880
I wanted it to be a robust, dark cake, 

371
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,640
that's either quite intimidating or quite inviting. 

372
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,160
I love the fact you wanted to create an intimidating cake. 

373
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,280
It's the first intimidating cake we've had on. 

374
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,800
- Flavours are lovely. Yeah. 
- It's nice with the fruit. 

375
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,840
The bake is good, the flavours are good. It's just too big, too cumbersome. 

376
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,560
I'm not intimidated by it. 

377
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,760
I'm just angry at myself. 

378
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm ashamed of myself because that isn't the type of stuff I bake. 

379
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,840
It was just a mess. I'm really upset with myself. 

380
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,320
I don't think I'm stuck in one period cos I can do modern as well. 

381
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,480
But just that particular one worked out 

382
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,880
that it looked '70s for some reason. 

383
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,480
I can't remember if it looked '70s or not. 

384
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,800
I have to make sure this afternoon's technical bake is spot-on and I don't panic and nothing goes wrong. 

385
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,760
I feel relieved that at least the first thing I've tried 

386
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,480
this weekend has gone down well. It's lovely. 

387
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,640
Apart from the lashings of booze, love, attention to detail, 

388
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,760
but mainly booze, that goes into making a great dessert, 

389
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,320
you need sugar. 

390
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,280
It took the dedication of one man 

391
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,320
to bring sugar to the dining tables of the masses. 

392
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,920
In the early 19th century, the sugar industry was hitting boom time. 

393
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,360
Ports like Bristol were reaping the rewards and yet for many, 

394
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,960
sugar remained an expensive luxury, 

395
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,920
tantalisingly out of reach of the ordinary working family. 

396
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,440
Sugar was such a highly prized commodity before 1874 

397
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,320
that it was referred to widely as white gold. 

398
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,320
At times, it even commanded the same price as gold. 

399
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,120
Sugar was very expensive because it was taxed really heavily. 

400
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,320
The Government knew that people wanted it. It was highly in demand. 

401
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,640
In 1815 alone, government revenue was Â£3 million. 

402
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,680
Profits from sugar were responsible for the flourishing 

403
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,080
of many of the UK's cities and Bristol is a case in point. 

404
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,920
Money from the sugar industry came pouring in. 

405
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,800
Merchants build these amazing houses, factories, sugar refineries. 

406
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,720
In many ways, you can actually say Bristol is a city built on sugar. 

407
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,360
Bristol's new-found wealth 

408
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,960
was reliant on the toil of the working classes, 

409
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,120
who laboured in these sugar refineries and warehouses. 

410
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,280
But because of the hefty tax on sugar, 

411
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,120
these were the very people who couldn't afford to buy it. 

412
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:31,600
When working families did get hold of sugar, they often had to settle for a far inferior product. 

413
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,840
The most infamous case of adulterated sugar 

414
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,280
was the Bradford sweet poisoning of 1858, 

415
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,800
which involved a local sweet seller called William Hardacre, 

416
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,400
or Humbug Billy, as he became known. 

417
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,720
The supplier he used for his sugar was notorious for adulterating it with a cheap substance called daft, 

418
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,840
an unpleasant mix of chalk and limestone. 

419
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,320
One day, the supplier muddled up the jar of daft 

420
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,600
with a jar of arsenic and so when William made his humbugs, 

421
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,560
each humbug contained nine grains of arsenic, which is twice the amount 

422
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,440
you need to kill a man and of course, people died. 

423
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,560
200 were poisoned. 

424
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,960
This was a massive scandal, a huge outcry, and the beginning 

425
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,360
of a demand that they had to make sugar cheaper and abolish the sugar tax. 

426
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,840
Prime Minister William Gladstone was the man who started to make 

427
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,920
things better for the sweet-toothed working classes. 

428
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,120
He felt that taxing foodstuffs vital to their staple diet was unfair 

429
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,240
and set about pushing through a series of reforms. 

430
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,480
William Gladstone was an economic liberal. 

431
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,280
He believed that the complicated system of tariffs, 

432
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,840
duties, customs, actually held the economy back, 

433
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,240
that a true, free, growing economy could only be created by abolishing 

434
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,000
all of these and he particularly wanted to abolish the tax on sugar. 

435
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,040
He also perhaps wanted to do this because he himself loved sugary desserts. 

436
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,800
His family teased him 

437
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,320
about his pleasingly childish greed for sugary sweet treats. 

438
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,520
In 1874, Gladstone succeeded. 

439
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,760
The sugar tax was lifted and all of a sudden, cheap good sugar was put 

440
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,480
in the reach of the working classes and desserts were changed for ever. 

441
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,320
As sugar finally became cheaper, 

442
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,680
all manner of previously unattainable sweet desserts 

443
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,760
took pride of place on the dining room tables of working families, 

444
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,920
whilst the upper classes began to focus on more refined uses of sugar, 

445
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,880
such as spun sugar and sugar craft. 

446
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,240
The fact that today people from all walks of life can now enjoy 

447
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,800
desserts that are safe, affordable and delicious is thanks largely 

448
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,840
to the pioneering reforms of one man, William Gladstone. 

449
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,040
'One dessert down, two to go.' 

450
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,040
Right, bakers, you know how we roll by now. 

451
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,120
Next up is the technical challenge. As ever, this is judged blind. 

452
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,960
Paul, Mary, I'm going to ask you to retire to the tepee of love 

453
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,640
and we will call upon your services later. 

454
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,920
Today's technical challenge is the mainstay of French cuisine. 

455
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,960
We're asking you to create a creme caramel. 

456
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,480
You've got to master a baked custard and caramel. 

457
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,360
You've got two and three-quarter hours to do it in. 

458
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,960
So on your marks, get set, bake. 

459
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,280
'With just four ingredients, milk, sugar, vanilla and eggs, 

460
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,360
'and a straightforward three-stage recipe, 

461
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,360
'the bakers may think this is going to be easy.' 

462
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,840
I must have had creme caramel at some point, but I can't remember ever having it. 

463
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,880
'But the key to creme caramel is precision.' 

464
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,760
I've made creme brulee before, which I think is quite similar. 

465
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,200
'The slightest mistake 

466
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,280
'and this technical challenge could be their last.' 

467
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,760
Mary, why have you chosen creme caramel? 

468
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,640
It is a classic, 

469
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,680
but there are plenty of places where they could go wrong. 

470
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,440
I've got a feeling that some of them will be trying to heat the eggs and the milk together. 

471
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,680
If they do that, it will curdle. 

472
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,200
The caramel, they could get it too light or too dark. 

473
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,560
That's fantastic. 

474
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,240
Caramel, it's not burned, it's got plenty of flavour. 

475
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,600
The texture's like milk. And it's still got that wobble as well. 

476
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,400
- Let's hope we get that replicated by the bakers.
- We shall see. 

477
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,520
Got to make the caramel first, that's going to be tricky in itself. 

478
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,760
Lots of opportunity to go wrong. 

479
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,640
'Caramel should be a straightforward mix of water and sugar.' 

480
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,000
Yeah. 

481
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,800
'Heated until the sugar has completely dissolved.' 

482
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,760
Although it's really tempting to stir this, I don't at all. 

483
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,320
It really is best just to leave it alone. 

484
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,440
'Manisha made caramel last week.' 

485
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,240
I had lots and lots and lots of issues with sugar and water. 

486
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,280
'But it took her eight attempts.' 

487
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,200
It's like the worst nightmare, this is. 

488
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,840
I'm just brushing away any little globules of sugar 

489
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,960
that might be on the side of the pan, so if they get into the caramel, 

490
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,760
they don't encourage it to crystallise. 

491
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,160
'The bakers need to time this stage precisely.' 

492
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,680
I'm just concentrating on not over-cooking my caramel. 

493
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,440
'The caramel will continue to colour and thicken.' 

494
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,080
Stop. 

495
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,200
'Even after it has been moved off the heat.' 

496
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,400
I don't know what the hell is going on with me today. I just... 

497
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,680
That's burnt. 

498
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,600
It's not crystallised, which is good. 

499
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,440
- It's a very nice dark creme caramel colour.
- I think it's burnt. 

500
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,520
- Let's smell it.
- It smells burnt. 
- Yes, it's burnt, love. That's burnt. 

501
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,360
- It'll be OK.
- Do it again. 

502
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,080
I'm going to watch this. 

503
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,800
It should be like a medium straw colour, not a light straw, 

504
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,680
but not as dark as it just was. 

505
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,040
I feel I'd rather do it under rather than over, you know? 

506
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,920
If it goes bitter, I'm in trouble. 

507
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,120
If it's slightly under, it's not the best caramel, but it'll do. 

508
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,080
'Once golden, the caramel should cover the bottom of the ramekins 

509
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,160
'before setting.' 

510
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,800
That's maybe a wee bit light, but it'll do. 

511
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,720
It's not doing it, I think I've messed this up. 

512
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,640
Did you not cool it for long enough? 

513
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
I think I probably cooled it too much. 

514
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,480
Oh, blast, never mind, it's awful, it's just sticking. 

515
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,720
I'm either guessing correctly 

516
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,760
or I've skipped a couple of steps. 

517
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,000
I'll soon find out. 

518
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,440
'Only once the ramekins are lined can the bakers move on.' 

519
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,320
The recipe is a bit vague with this one. 

520
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,360
It just says, "Make the custard." 

521
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,560
'The bakers have been given vanilla extract, sugar, full fat milk 

522
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,520
'and eggs.' 

523
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,000
This is the weird thing. 

524
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,960
I always thought custard would just require egg yolks and not egg whites 

525
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,360
but it doesn't say anything about separating the eggs 

526
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,080
and it says four eggs rather than four egg yolks. 

527
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,360
Maybe I'll go with it and put all the eggs in. 

528
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,320
Whole eggs? Heaven knows. 

529
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,040
I've got no idea. 

530
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,640
I'm just going to go with my gut instinct and go with just egg yolks. 

531
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,680
But I think that might be a mistake. 

532
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,840
I made a creme brulee before, 

533
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,320
but not creme caramel. 

534
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,440
So who knows how it's going to go. 

535
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,000
'The milk needs to be warm enough to thicken the custard.' 

536
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,200
I don't know when to put the eggs in, that's the thing, it's scary. 

537
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,360
'But not too warm as the eggs will scramble.' 

538
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,320
My custard is just not getting thick. 

539
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,000
How thick is it supposed to get? 

540
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,360
This won't thicken. 

541
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,000
I got splodge and it's, you know, bottom of the pile straight away. 

542
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I am quite aware I need to get it into the oven... 

543
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,560
pretty soon. 

544
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,240
OK, bakers, an hour to go, you better scramble. 

545
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,600
Don't scramble, whatever you do. 

546
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,560
Nice, even consistency. 

547
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,600
Right, go! 

548
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,160
I'm doing the mad panic I didn't really want to be doing. 

549
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,320
It does look a bit lumpy, but I've got no choice now, it has to go in. 

550
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,840
The bakers have been told to use a bain-marie. 

551
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,200
None of us know should it be hot water in the bain-marie 

552
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,880
or cold water - I've gone for lukewarm. 

553
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,520
'The water should help keep the temperature around the ramekins consistent, 

554
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,400
'giving the custard a more tender texture when set.' 

555
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,000
OK. 

556
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,040
I'm going in. 

557
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,880
Apart from the oven temperature 

558
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,000
we really are on our own again. 

559
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,640
'The bakers don't just have to gauge their oven time accurately.' 

560
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,200
I'm working by instinct, 

561
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,320
rather than knowledge. 

562
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,960
'They also have to allow their creme caramel enough time to cool.' 

563
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,120
I need to go pee. 

564
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,320
'Hot creme caramel won't turn out of the ramekin.' 

565
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,480
Hello, hello, are you in there? 

566
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,040
HE HUMS 

567
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,040
I think because it hasn't got the egg white in, it hasn't got 

568
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,480
that protein structure, 

569
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,800
so it's not holding its shape 

570
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,640
and its wobble as much as it should. 

571
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,680
So... 

572
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,680
Plopadops. 

573
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,040
I think I'm ready to take mine out. 

574
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,520
HE LAUGHS 

575
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,400
# All by myself... # 

576
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,560
Disaster creme brulees. 

577
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,640
SHE LAUGHS 

578
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,880
I'm quite happy with those, they look good. 

579
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,080
Got a nice little wobble in the middle. 

580
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,920
The creme caramel has not set 

581
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,800
so I'm hoping the freezer will set it, 

582
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,080
but I very much doubt it will. 

583
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,000
OK, this is your ten-minute turnout call. 

584
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,280
Let's see 'em, come on! 

585
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,360
Let's see them caramels! 

586
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,520
< BANGING ON PLATE 

587
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,960
It's cracked a bit. 

588
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,040
Whoops! 

589
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,000
Oh, that's a shame. 

590
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,440
It came out in one piece 

591
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,080
and it's got caramel on the top. No, I'm happy. 

592
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,320
< BANGING ON PLATE 

593
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,520
There's no caramel whatsoever. The caramel's stuck to the bottom. 

594
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,480
Oh, my goodness! 

595
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,200
There's little bits of broken china on there and everything. 

596
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,080
- Turn it.
- No. 

597
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,440
If you don't, I will. 

598
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,360
I'll let Paul turn it over. 

599
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,240
No, that's the rule, you have to turn them out. 

600
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,040
The caramel is too pale. 

601
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,520
You know, your fate can change in an instant here. 

602
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,680
SHE GIGGLES 

603
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,240
Bleugh! 

604
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,880
That's what I thought. 

605
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,040
OK, bakers, it's time up. 

606
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,840
- What do you think overall, Mary? 
- They're certainly different. 

607
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,680
The colour of this, the caramel's not cooked, 

608
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,120
it's not caramel, is it? It's coloured water. 

609
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,240
It's a bit scrambled egg-like inside. 

610
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,480
This one's gone slightly darker 

611
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,000
and it's got a little bit of caramel there. 

612
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,040
- The texture on this one is smoother. 
- A subtle wobble to it, it's not too set. 

613
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:06,000
When we come to this one it's got a nice caramel colour 

614
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,920
which we've been looking for. 

615
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,680
Let's look at the texture. 

616
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,000
It's got a good wobble. 

617
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,080
Lovely and creamy, it's just perfect, isn't it? 

618
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,280
They're not bad, them, at all. 

619
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,840
"Not bad" means that they're really quite good. 

620
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,800
It's a nice caramel, actually. 

621
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,640
I thought it was a little bit burnt 

622
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,360
but actually the flavour of that is pretty good. 

623
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,560
These for some reason have got a little ring in the top. 

624
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:35,440
But perhaps when the caramel went in a spoon was put around it. 

625
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,040
But looking at the next one, you're not making a creme patissiere, 

626
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,360
you're making a creme caramel, two very different things. 

627
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,680
This one looks good, although it may be slightly overdone, 

628
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:51,120
but the caramel is lovely and smooth, but it needed to come out earlier. 

629
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,440
Creme caramel, that's the key thing, caramel. 

630
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,760
Not liquid sugar water. 

631
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,960
We have another one that would have to be served in cups. 

632
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,400
These two were standing next to each other and they were looking over at each other. 

633
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,280
You can't deny that's got a wobble. 

634
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,080
It has definitely got a wobble. 

635
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,160
The caramel is good, probably slightly overdone. 

636
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,200
'But whose creme caramel has turned out on top?' 

637
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:23,440
So we start from the bottom and this is the last one here. 

638
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,960
I added only egg yolks and no egg whites. 

639
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,360
- Number eight. It's this one. 
- Same thing. 

640
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,520
Next one, number seven. 

641
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,480
A little bit pale. 

642
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,360
And a bit like scrambled egg as well. 

643
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,240
And number six. This one? 

644
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,040
I burnt the first batch 

645
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,120
- so I was cautious about the caramel. 
- You went from the opposite end of the pole. 

646
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,840
James takes fifth, 

647
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,440
Sarah-Jane fourth, 

648
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,400
and Cathryn third. 

649
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,080
Number two is this one. 

650
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,520
Well done - smooth, nice size, great flavour. 

651
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,280
And here we come to one that has a perfect topping, 

652
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,040
lovely texture, 

653
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,480
good wobble, perfect. 

654
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,920
- Great wobble, Brendan.
- Thank you. 

655
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,280
That's the first technical bake where I've become number one. 

656
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,280
I'm a slow developer, I've decided. 

657
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,120
I'm going to have to try to get Mary drunk again tomorrow. 

658
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:20,560
Wear an even lower vest top, maybe. I don't know. 

659
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,400
I'm definitely in the danger zone, definitely, 

660
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,960
and in fact probably will be going home tomorrow. 

661
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:33,120
If everything goes well and if I beat Manisha, maybe I'll be safe. 

662
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,680
It's the final dessert challenge, 

663
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,960
and for someone, it will be their last in the bake-off. 

664
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,040
Good morning, bakers. 

665
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,880
Welcome to yet another howling, sub-zero, Great British summer day. 

666
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,440
Now, it's the Showstopper Challenge. 

667
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,400
What we're looking for is a layered meringue dessert. 

668
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,400
We need four layers, and you can fill them and top them 

669
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,000
and dress them in any way you like. 

670
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,160
Very best of luck. 

671
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,680
On your marks, get set, bake. 

672
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,600
I've chosen a layered meringue because it is pretty difficult. 

673
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,920
They've got to get each layer right 

674
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,400
and have exciting fillings that will compliment the meringue. 

675
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,360
They've to get the textures right, 

676
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,080
so if they want a crispy meringue, they've got to dry it out 

677
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,320
in the oven for at least an hour and leave it to cool for at least an hour. 

678
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,920
Their towering meringues can be layered with whatever they choose, 

679
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,880
be it mousse, sponge, cream or coulis. 

680
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,040
It's a true test of technical talent, flavour, 

681
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,440
texture combinations and construction. 

682
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,520
Oh, dear. 

683
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,520
Most bakers have chosen to base their desserts 

684
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,360
on the classic French meringue, 

685
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,480
made by whisking stiff egg whites and sugar. 

686
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,040
I just pulled the whisk off and look at that. 

687
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,760
Never done it for me before. 

688
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,280
Sugar is added bit by bit to stabilize the mixture. 

689
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,240
You can't mess around with the addition of sugar. 

690
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,320
One of the reasons meringues weep, 

691
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,000
is if you don't dissolve the sugar in the egg white properly. 

692
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,080
Danny has named her showstopper Monte Bianco. 

693
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,080
Layered with a chestnut and chocolate mousse, 

694
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,640
her meringue is a coffee dacqouise, or as I call it, 'dakees'. 

695
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,640
What is a 'dakees'? 

696
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,080
It is with a nut in the meringue, and so you've got almond in there. 

697
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,360
I've got almond but I'm sprinkling ground hazelnuts on top because I've got three mousse layers. 

698
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,920
It's tricky. It isn't a classic meringue, 

699
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,640
and wants to be eaten within an hour or two hours, 

700
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,360
because when all that moisture gets into the meringue, 

701
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,600
- it's almost like a total mousse, isn't it?
- Yes. 

702
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,440
I'm pouring in the sugar syrup into the meringue. 

703
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,800
The sugar syrup is maybe a wee bit hot still. 

704
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,600
As usual, James is making life difficult for himself. 

705
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,600
- Hello.
- Hello, James. What's the meringue? 

706
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,600
An Italian meringue, which is why it's hot. 

707
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:10,320
- Did you boil your sugar?
- Yes, yes. 
- You did?
- 118 degrees. 

708
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,440
James is layering his meringue with fig, chestnuts, cherries 

709
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,760
and a chocolate ganache. 

710
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,800
Isn't Italian meringue more stable than a French meringue? 

711
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,400
Yeah, you can play with it a lot more. 

712
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,000
- Is that what you like about it? 
- You can smash it down. 

713
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,040
Boil your sugar and put it into a mix. 

714
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,320
You can eat it straight away 

715
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,560
because you're cooking the eggs with the temperature of the sugar. 

716
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,680
- So you can stick your finger in if you like.
- That's all I wanted. 

717
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,720
- He knows me so well. 
- I'm looking forward to this. 

718
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,400
- I'm looking forward to this one too. Good luck.
- Thank you. 

719
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,320
Delicious. Lovely. 

720
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,640
But Sarah Jane has travelled even further for her meringue. 

721
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,280
I'm making the base for the Swiss meringue, 

722
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:58,120
so you just heat together the sugar, the egg whites and cream of tartar 

723
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:02,520
till the sugar dissolves, and then whisk it until it's how you want it. 

724
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,720
She's making a tiramisu inspired meringue tower, 

725
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,640
where layers of chocolate sponge and hazelnut liqueur-flavoured mascarpone cream 

726
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,880
will fit in between delicate, heart-shaped, Swiss meringue layers. 

727
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,640
Because they've got to be quite thin they were fragile when I did them the normal way, 

728
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,320
but the Swiss one seems to make them quite shiny 

729
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,920
and crisp on the outside, but really chewy in the middle. 

730
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,240
So the French meringue, you end up with a broken heart? 

731
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,280
- It's not good.
- No.
- No. 

732
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,160
Last week went brilliantly well, and it just seems 

733
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,080
to all have gone downhill again, 

734
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:39,520
so hopefully with this bake I'll be able to turn it back around and be better again. 

735
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:44,680
Stuart is hoping to keep his place with a choca blocka mocha meringue, 

736
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:48,600
layered with vanilla sponge and chocolate ganache. 

737
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,520
So, Stuart, how many layers have you got? 

738
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,560
It's round about six. 

739
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,320
Will they be crispy? 

740
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,840
Mixed between crispy, crunchy and chewy. 

741
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,600
Can you not... Listen. 

742
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:04,160
If you make your mind up on what you want to do with your layers, 

743
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,600
what consistency do you want your meringues to have? 

744
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,400
- Commit, Stuart!
- Kind of a chewy... 

745
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,720
- Kind of a chewy or chewy? 
- I want it chewy. 

746
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,360
- So it's chewy.
- Yeah. 

747
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,960
I think it's going to be a huge surprise at the end for you and for us. 

748
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,360
Yeah. I think so. 

749
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,800
It's a voyage of discovery all round. 

750
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,560
Meringue expands as it bakes, so it's usually piped 

751
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,040
onto flat baking sheets to give it room for growth. 

752
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,280
I'm going to bake my meringues in sandwich tins. 

753
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,560
Normally I swirl it onto a baking tray like a circle 

754
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,920
and then build a stack. 

755
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,280
Ryan is adding to his workload by creating a strawberry 

756
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,600
and pistachio meringue and a rose and raspberry mousse. 

757
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,760
Are you feeling scared? Is the pressure on? 

758
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,160
It is a bit, because today I'm not really safe. 

759
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,120
There's a lot of weight always put on this third challenge 

760
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,200
because this the big party piece, so you've got to be good for it. 

761
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,960
With two solid bakes under his belt, 

762
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,520
Brendan has got his sights on Star Baker. 

763
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,280
I wanted to do something a bit special, 

764
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,200
and the elements of this are quite advanced. 

765
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,800
Brendan's demonstrating his skills with a pear, chocolate and hazelnut dacqouise, 

766
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,600
with a hazelnut mousse and a dark chocolate ganache. 

767
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,400
This is the ganache, which will go on the outside, 

768
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,920
and that's been made with some hazelnut oil and Frangelico liqueur. 

769
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,200
That's the ganache that's going to go on the outside. 

770
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,880
Why have you done it now? 

771
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,960
From working with it at home, it takes a good hour 

772
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,880
and a half to two to get it to the piping consistency that I want. 

773
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,400
And decoration, are you going for disco or glam rock? 

774
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,480
What are you going for? 

775
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,440
I'm going for classical elegance, actually. 

776
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,000
Meringues take at least an hour to bake. 

777
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,800
But not everyone's in a hurry. 

778
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,240
- Hello, Cathryn.
- Hello. 

779
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,600
Whereabouts are you up to now with your meringue? 

780
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:08,160
I'm not. I haven't started it yet. I'm just waiting. 

781
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,200
My honey cake's coming out in about ten minutes. 

782
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,760
I just wanted to get that done and then make a start on my meringue. 

783
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:20,360
Cathryn is making a gooseberry, almond, honey meringue with layers of honey sponge. 

784
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,400
Is it quite a stable thing? Does it tend to collapse? Does it soften? 

785
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:30,120
It can look slightly monstrous. But it does hold its shape. 

786
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:34,320
- Right, so it's Frankenstein's cake, basically.
- No, it's not. Well... 

787
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:39,000
It's hard... I have found it hard to make it look delicate. 

788
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,160
- It's not delicate. 
- It's the Honey Monster. 

789
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,400
We've got the Honey Monster coming. 

790
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,800
Once the meringues are baked, it's crucial to let them dry out 

791
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,400
for at least two hours, otherwise their sides will crack and crumble. 

792
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,280
Oh, that's hot. 

793
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:03,360
Just letting the air out, you know, so it can start drying a little bit. 

794
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,720
By keeping them in the oven with the heat turned off, 

795
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,680
the outside will become crisp whilst leaving the centre soft and chewy. 

796
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,680
This is definitely an endurance bake. I've got to make a ganache 

797
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,920
and I've completely forgotten about that. I need to get that done. 

798
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,080
Sorry, but I'm going to have to crack on. 

799
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,720
If he can keep on top of his timings, 

800
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,800
John is making an elderflower and brambleberry layered meringue, 

801
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,520
with tempered chocolate and a raspberry coulis. 

802
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,480
Is it going to be a chocolate breeze block? 

803
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,080
It's going to be big, but I'm hoping it will be a bit more elegant. 

804
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:43,120
It has collapsed in the past, so I'm going to paint the meringues 

805
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,960
when they're dry and cooled with a bit of white chocolate 

806
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,160
and that should stop too much absorption from the cream. 

807
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,240
Drying meringues is vital. 

808
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,200
That looks actually quite pretty nice, I must say. 

809
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,480
Those without a crisp surface will absorb any fillings and collapse. 

810
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,520
My fourth meringue is not setting, 

811
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,680
so I'm going to attempt to make another one now. 

812
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,160
I'm not sure if I've got time for it, but I've got no choice now. 

813
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,480
- Hi, Paul.
- Am I not wanted at the moment? 

814
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,360
- No, you're always wanted. 
- It's a mess. 

815
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,560
Yes, it is. 

816
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,640
So you're happy with all your meringues? 

817
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,400
No, because this one is not drying. It's been in there for two hours. 

818
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,560
- Two hours?
- I don't know why. 

819
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,880
I've just bunged in another one straight away now. 

820
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,520
This is knocking me back time-wise. 

821
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,120
- It's going to eat into my presentation.
- I'll leave you to it. 

822
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,720
It's essential that the bakers' chosen fillings 

823
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,800
work in harmony with their meringues. 

824
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,200
I'm trying to extract as much moisture out of the pears as possible, 

825
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:11,120
because they're going to be interleaved with the meringue. 

826
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,960
And moisture and meringue don't go together. 

827
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,920
I'm putting four different types of cream. 

828
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,480
A Tia Maria cream, a Kahlua cream, 

829
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:21,960
a chocolate cream and a Chantilly cream. 

830
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,320
Manisha's four cream-filled French coffee meringue layers 

831
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,880
will be topped with hand piped chocolate hearts and gold leaf. 

832
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,560
Oh, just stick, why don't you? 

833
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,400
Going to try and make the flavours nice. 

834
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,840
I can make anything look quite pretty anyway, 

835
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,760
but the flavours have to go really well, 

836
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,720
and if the flavours are not there, then, you know... 

837
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,800
Bakers, that's half an hour to go. Just 30 minutes left. 

838
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,480
The crunch point is when to assemble, 

839
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,200
because after I have assembled it, 

840
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,040
it's not going to take long for it to just go... (WHISTLES) 

841
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,240
So I'm going to have to be quite quick. 

842
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,400
After the failure of one of his layers, 

843
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:09,040
Ryan's emergency meringue is presenting its own problems. 

844
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:13,800
It's going to be bigger than the tower, and part of this tower is meant to go straight up. 

845
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,040
That would've sat there perfectly, and it would have held the cream 

846
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,760
and everything would come into place. 

847
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,000
The new meringue will be bigger, so it will just look odd. 

848
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,720
Are you going to leave time to finish? 

849
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,560
- You know you've got to make this look good.
- Well...
- No. 

850
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:43,080
- I've never finished it properly before.
- Commit! 

851
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,880
I don't want to commit myself, because if something goes wrong, 

852
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,960
I'll go, "Oh, yeah, I chose that anyway." 

853
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,520
You can't create something and then back reference what it is, 

854
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,880
if you know what I mean, post-rationalise what it is. 

855
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,360
Well, if I haven't created it anyway, how can I? 

856
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,880
This is getting way too meta. 

857
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,760
I mean, this is becoming BBC Four as we're talking. 

858
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,120
That's five minutes. Just five minutes left. 

859
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,040
It's leaning that way. 

860
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,880
I want them just to see it now, then I can go home. 

861
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,880
That's it. Time up. Step away from the cakes. 

862
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,160
Step away. 

863
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:54,400
- James, stop polishing your figs. 
- GIGGLES 

864
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,320
I can hear a bit of crispness as we go through. 

865
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,120
Well, you got your layers, 

866
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,360
but when I initially look at it, it doesn't really work. 

867
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,160
- It's just too much going on there. 
- OK. 

868
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,200
The meringue's OK. It is crispy. 

869
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,520
Has got flavour, but for me, it doesn't work cos the textures aren't right in the mousse, 

870
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,800
and I think the whole thing has gone a bit off-kilter for me. 

871
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,560
This is awkward. 

872
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,400
I don't like it. 

873
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,640
There's no definitive "that's what it is". 

874
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,080
If you start with enough, five, six different flavours, I switch off. 

875
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:59,280
It is a huge mixture of flavours, but, erm... I don't dislike it. 

876
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,960
- It's rather an exotic fruit salad within a meringue.
- Yeah. 

877
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,400
I like the look of it. I think it looks pretty good. 

878
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,360
That does look fun when you cut through, doesn't it? 

879
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,560
I'm a little sad I haven't got any crispness from the meringue, 

880
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,840
but interesting fillings. 

881
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:29,240
- It just feels a little bit stodgy, which I wasn't expecting.
- OK. 

882
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,040
I think it looks good, actually. It looks interesting. 

883
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,200
I'm going to cut down the middle and see. 

884
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:42,640
As you cut it, each person gets a very nice looking piece. 

885
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,920
It's always risky with pear because of the moisture. 

886
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,960
- Lovely. Really nice.
- Good. 

887
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,600
It's actually... It's quite delicate. 

888
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,440
The flavour is absolutely lovely. 

889
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,920
The pear and chocolate meringue all goes very well. 

890
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,640
- Very well done.
- Lovely. 
- Well done, Brendan. 

891
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,240
Nice crisp on the meringue. 

892
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,360
It's very tricky to get into this one. 

893
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,280
- I like it, actually.
- Well done. 
- Yeah, well done. 

894
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:32,360
- I think I could do with the sponge being a little bit thinner.
- Yes. 

895
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,840
But the gooseberries are coming through. 

896
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:39,040
- It's a nice gooseberry sponge cake, that.
- Oh. OK. 

897
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,080
Struggling to find the meringue, though. 

898
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,280
I think it needed to be sharper. 

899
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,840
OK. It doesn't really look like a heart. 

900
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,000
We were asking you for a meringue there. 

901
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,080
We've got almost as much chocolate in as we've got meringue, 

902
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,200
but it does remind me of tiramisu. 

903
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,440
That's good. One good thing about it. 

904
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,000
Stuart, you imagined this as your showstopper on the table. 

905
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,800
You look at and you think, it's a meringue cake, 

906
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,240
but I would like some form of decoration on top, 

907
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,640
because it doesn't tempt me to see what's inside. 

908
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,040
That's tough! 

909
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,200
You could wedge a door open with that. 

910
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,640
I wouldn't know that there was a meringue in there, 

911
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,000
and it's really like a layered trifle to me. 

912
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,800
I love the outside of it. 

913
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:37,240
I can't identify the flavours cos there's so many things going on. 

914
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,320
- That is a crowning glory, isn't it? 
- Good piping work. 

915
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,200
And it's rather nice to have this crispness on top. 

916
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,560
Don't like it. And I'll tell you why. 

917
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,760
The meringue texture is excellent. It's just too bitter. 

918
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,240
I disagree with you. I have got a very sweet tooth. 

919
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,680
I think it's plenty sweet enough for me. 

920
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,880
I'm in serious danger. 

921
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,120
I think I'm in really serious danger today, so, you know, it's worrying. 

922
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,920
I suppose that's the way it goes. 

923
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:26,320
You have good days and bad days and for me, unfortunately, 

924
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,920
it's been a bad weekend. 

925
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,360
I've made quite a few errors, 

926
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,840
and these are not tiny errors, these are, like, huge errors. 

927
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,160
Mary and Paul have made their decision. 

928
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,240
Let's start with the fun bit. 

929
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,840
The Star Baker this week is somebody who showed real skill, 

930
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,960
real dexterity and an awful lot of flair. 

931
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:54,840
Of course flares were incredibly popular in the 1970s, 

932
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:59,160
from which the great man Brendan takes inspiration. Well done! 

933
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,200
Obviously for one person, 

934
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,160
the bake-off experience has to stop today. 

935
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,200
And the person who won't be coming with us is... 

936
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,320
..Stuart. 

937
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:24,280
We're going to miss you, Stuart. Come on. Go on! 

938
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,040
Yeah, it's my time to go, but I'm gutted still. 

939
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:35,120
The kids at school will give me a bit of jip about it, but, erm... 

940
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:38,640
I think, hopefully, they'll commend me for putting myself forward. 

941
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:42,440
It was unfortunate, because the guy's got a gift in baking, 

942
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,280
but everybody else has raised their game as well, so it's tricky. 

943
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:50,000
The standards are high this year, and any flaw, that could be it. 

944
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,440
- Well done, Ryan.
- Thank you. 
- Raise your game. Raise your game. 

945
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,040
When Paul shook my hand, I got the drift that I was close today, 

946
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,160
so I have to do better next time round. 

947
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,160
I came this weekend with a very different mindset, 

948
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,280
and clearly it's worked, 

949
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:10,000
so now I can get down to some really serious baking. 

950
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,480
Oh, my cupcakes. 

951
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,520
That was intense! 

952
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:18,040
Next time, it's pies. 

953
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,720
Very exciting. 

954
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,240
I don't think I can handle the pressure. 

955
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:26,000
The bakers produce a signature bake with a bit of welly. 

956
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,400
Oh, dear. 

957
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,000
This is going to go really wrong. 

958
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,480
They take on a technical challenge that has them all stuck. 

959
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,320
Oh, look at that. It's just a disgrace from start to finish. 

960
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:40,240
And Mary and Paul's tastebuds are tantalised. 

961
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,720
- You've absolutely nailed that. 
- Sheer perfection. 

962
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,880
