1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,960
Just when you thought things couldn't get any more exciting, 

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,040
a baking injury turned our search to find Britain's best amateur baker 

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,520
right on its head. 

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,280
Faced with an impossible decision, 

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,280
Mary and Paul chose to keep all seven bakers, 

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,480
but this week seven become five. 

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,200
Ooh, who'd have thought baking could get this tough? 

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,960
We're the Ross Kemp of buns, we are. 

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,200
- Welcome...
- ..to The Great British Bake Off. 

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,040
Last time, the bakers delved into puddings. 

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,520
My strudel's got a haemorrhage. 

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,600
But an accident for John... 

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,120
What an idiot. 

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,040
..led to an unprecedented decision. 

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,880
No-one's going, because it just wasn't fair. 

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,520
And Brendan was crowned Star Baker for a second time. 

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,280
It's the one, the only Brendan - Star Baker, well done. 

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,600
This week, the bakers get stuck into sweet buns... 

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,840
Yes! 

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,920
..inject their technical skill into doughnuts... 

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,800
Doughnut doom! 

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,240
..and it's a bun fight to the finish. 

23
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,040
- It's raw.
- Raw?! 

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,560
GASPS 

25
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,600
What's done is done and cannot be undone. 

26
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,320
For the first time on the Bake Off, the bakers will need to 

27
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,600
master the art of making enriched sweet dough. 

28
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,160
Bakers, it seems as if seven is your lucky number. 

29
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,720
There were seven of you last week 

30
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,960
and, look, seven of you again this week. 

31
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,160
But I'm afraid your luck will run out this week, 

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,480
because we will be saying goodbye to two of you. But let's crack on 

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,600
with the baking now and start with our Signature Challenge, 

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,000
- as we always do. 
- Today we'd like you to make 24 buns. 

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,680
They can be Bath buns, Chelsea buns, Colston buns, 

36
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,800
Devonshire Revel buns, Mary Berry's hot and firm buns - 

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,280
it doesn't really matter, we just need 24 of them 

38
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,880
and they need to be made with yeast. And you've got three hours. 

39
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,280
- So on your marks.
- Get set.
- Bake! 

40
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,600
Enriched dough begins as a basic bread mixture using flour, 

41
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,840
salt, yeast and water. 

42
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,120
I prefer using fresh yeast, I think it gives a better flavour 

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,880
and also it gives an extra springiness to the finished dough. 

44
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,840
It's usually enriched by adding eggs, fat, sugar, milk, 

45
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,920
or a combination of these. 

46
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,120
They've got to get their mix right, 

47
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,560
they've got to get their base dough right. It must be soft 

48
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,360
and it must be bordering on the wet. 

49
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,360
If you go for a tight dough, you end up with very small air holes 

50
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,440
and the product will end up being crusty, rather than being soft. 

51
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,840
Very, very hard challenge. 

52
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,120
Paul is particularly fussy 

53
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,720
that every bun is the same size and every one is baked evenly, 

54
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,360
so we shall just see what they get up to. 

55
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,880
British sweet buns range from lardy cakes to Bath buns, 

56
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,720
Cornish saffron buns to Chelsea buns. 

57
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,440
Four of the remaining seven bakers are putting their twist 

58
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,600
on the classic 18th-century Chelsea bun. 

59
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,520
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Brendan. 
- That looks a very nice dough. 

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,720
- Thank you.
- Have you done it by hand? 
- Yes.
- That's good to see. 

61
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,000
Semi-retired recruitment consultant Brendan has been Star Baker twice. 

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,320
That is a perfect creme anglaise. It's good sponge, too. 

63
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,240
It's the one, the only Brendan - Star Baker. 

64
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,400
He's giving his Chelsea buns an Eastern European flavour. 

65
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,200
I called them Chelsea Bunskis, simply because 

66
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,360
I'm going to put a Polish poppy seed filling 

67
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,920
into the Chelsea, to replace the Chelsea filling. 

68
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,640
So you're going to fill it with poppies...poppy seeds? 

69
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,120
Poppy-seed mixture which... It's really flavoured with lemon vanilla. 

70
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,400
- You could call them bunkowiecs. 
- Really?
- Because the poppy seed cake 

71
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,040
is called makowiecs, so this would be bunkowiecs. 

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,320
You must show me how to spell it, and that's what we'll name them. 

73
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,280
I'm making a variant of a Chelsea bun, 

74
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,200
but, cos I'm from South Yorkshire and close to Bakewell, 

75
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,040
it's actually Bakewell-inspired. 

76
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,480
Intensive care doctor Danny 

77
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,840
has had her fair share of baking accidents and emergencies. 

78
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,240
Oh, no! 

79
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,320
I could cry! 

80
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,480
Her Bakewell-inspired Chelsea buns 

81
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,200
are flavoured with sour cherries and almonds. 

82
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,360
Are you putting almond extract in there as well? 

83
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,760
Yes. It needs a bit of boosting. 

84
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,520
So the tricky thing has actually been getting the frangipane 

85
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,560
not to put too much moisture into the bread. 

86
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,920
You want enough so it actually binds when it spirals up, 

87
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,280
- but doesn't leave too much of a gap. 
- Yeah.
- But they should fill it well. 

88
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,040
I look forward to these, though, the Chelsea Bakewells. 

89
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,920
I've decided they're Bakewell buns. Derbyshire's going to reclaim them! 

90
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,480
I'm making Easter Chelsea buns, so it's basically hot cross buns, 

91
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,640
Chelsified. 

92
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,600
Medical student James is never afraid to try something different. 

93
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,000
These bits of muslin 

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,960
are what the clootie dumplings are going to be boiled in. 

95
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,080
His version of Chelsea buns are made with wholemeal flour and cider. 

96
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,840
I think it just adds a little bit of extra bready flavour. 

97
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,040
Gets a bit sweet, 

98
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,760
you don't want to forget you're having a little bit of bread. 

99
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,520
It's got less gluten in, marginally less gluten in than a white. 

100
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,920
Have you got any white in there? 

101
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,080
- Yeah, it's about 70/30, white/wholemeal.
- Yeah. OK. 

102
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,840
You know, it's quite a tight challenge, 

103
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,600
so I'm quite nervous about this, to be honest. 

104
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,320
That's the nature of life, isn't it? 

105
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,080
Last week, law student John had an altercation with a food processor. 

106
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,680
Listen, the last thing you need to worry about right now is a strudel. 

107
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,880
John is also making Chelsea buns 

108
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,080
flavoured with cherry, almond and saffron. 

109
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,200
- Hello, hot stuff.
- Hello! 

110
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,360
I notice you're still rocking the Dr Strangelove glove. 

111
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,040
Quite an emotional week for you last week, because obviously, 

112
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,560
for a start, you had to leave. How did that feel? 

113
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,320
I was gutted, to be honest, cos, you know, I thought someone 

114
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,680
was going to go out, so when I heard no-one had gone 

115
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,800
I was just so relieved, it was just wicked. 

116
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,280
But now obviously there's two people going this week 

117
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,480
and obviously Paul and Mary are going to be watching me like hawks. 

118
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,760
It's just milk, sugar, rose water and yeast, and I'm just... 

119
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,760
I've heated up my milk and I'm just leaving it for ten minutes 

120
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,400
for the yeast to start bubbling. 

121
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,560
- Morning, Cathryn.
- Good morning. 
- Tell us about your buns, please. 

122
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,360
They're called Lady Arundel's Manchet buns. 

123
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,600
- Hello!
- I want to do something regional to me, so I was looking at Sussex and found these. 

124
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,640
It's a very old bun. Lady Arundel's Manchet goes back to the 1500s. 

125
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,560
- I wanted to tell you that, cos I knew that!
- I'm sorry. 

126
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,680
Go on, tell me, Lady Arundel, fascinating! 

127
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,480
- No, I don't know anything, that was it, that was all I knew!
- Sorry! 

128
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,000
Young mum Cathryn has overcome her nerves, 

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,120
and is becoming one of the most consistent bakers. 

130
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,840
It's good strudel, it's nice and thin, and the interior's delicious. 

131
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,520
Thanks. 

132
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,480
She's found her own way to embellish these centuries-old yeasted buns. 

133
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,960
My sort of twist on them, I'm just going to split them 

134
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,720
and then fill them with cream and jam. 

135
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,040
Because it does say they're a kind of yeasted scone, 

136
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,600
so that's why I'm doing cream... No? 

137
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,480
- I definitely read that.
- Yeah, I wouldn't necessarily agree with that.
- She knows, you know! 

138
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,840
You're making me sound like I don't know, but I did feel like 

139
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,480
- I was a bit prepared! 
- No, you do... 

140
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,600
Now I feel like I don't know anything about them. 

141
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,680
It's a great idea, you've blended several different things 

142
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,480
- to come up with a brand-new, unique one.
- Thanks.
- He's creeping round you now, don't you think so?! 

143
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,800
All I'm really worried about 

144
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,040
is making sure I can hand in something which I feel is decent, 

145
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,480
and up to my standard. 

146
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,240
So far, photographer Ryan's creations have had a mixed response. 

147
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,400
- They look indulgent. 
- Got a very dry texture. 

148
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Those are a bit thick, but the flavour of it I really like. 

149
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Typically, lardy cakes are made as one large cake, 

150
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,200
invented by farmers to use leftover pig fat. 

151
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,520
He's creating miniature versions filled with raisins. 

152
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,280
Now I have to make them individually, roll them out, 

153
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,640
put some lard on it, fold 'em, rest 'em, more lard, bit of raisins, 

154
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,880
flavouring, re-fold them and then prove it. 

155
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,320
So... Times 24, so that all eats up into the time. 

156
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,880
I'm making a Cornish saffron bun. They should be 

157
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,440
little perfectly round little domed orange shiny buns. 

158
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,800
So...that's what I'm aiming for, anyway. 

159
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,320
Stay-at-home mum Sarah-Jane has a classic baking style 

160
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,240
that can divide the judges. 

161
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,800
- It's a little on the dry side, a little over-baked.
- Right, OK. 

162
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,440
I disagree with you, Mary. 

163
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,280
I think it's actually all right. 

164
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,000
She's adding nutmeg and orange 

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,080
to boost the flavour of her Cornish saffron buns. 

166
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,320
I've got loads to prove after last week, 

167
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,640
cos I was really close to going home last week. 

168
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,360
But I don't want to get too stressed. 

169
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,280
I bake best when I'm kind of, you know, relaxed 

170
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,240
and, you know, enjoying it. 

171
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,600
The bakers' dough will need to be proved twice. 

172
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,400
Enriched dough takes longer to prove than normal bread dough, 

173
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,800
as the added sugar and fat slows down the yeast's development. 

174
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,920
While the dough proves for the first time, the bakers 

175
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,120
take the opportunity to prepare their fillings. 

176
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,680
- Now that's ground-up poppy seed... 
- Yeah. 

177
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,280
..with orange zest and lemon zest and the juice of the lemon. 

178
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,720
- I can smell it, you know. 
- Milk, yeah? 

179
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,120
Oh, I like that! 

180
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,680
This is a Morello cherry extract, and it just kind of oomphs up the cherry. 

181
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,600
I know that one of my failings in Paul's eyes 

182
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,480
is that I haven't got quite the finesse of some of the others, 

183
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,640
so I'm going to try and be a little bit more consistent. 

184
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,680
Bakers, there's one hour until I can sink my teeth into your buns! 

185
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,720
Psyching myself up! 

186
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,040
Because this is the bit that's going to kill me. 

187
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,520
If I don't do this in half an hour, I'm out of time. 

188
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,520
With the clock ticking, the bakers must work quickly 

189
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,120
to evenly fill and neatly shape their buns. 

190
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,760
All 24 are then ready for the second proving. 

191
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,600
Can I just count I've got 12? 

192
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,480
Yeah, I've got 12, that's fine, 

193
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,360
I just had a funny five minutes when I wasn't sure that I had 12. Right. 

194
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,920
There's absolutely technique to this at all, 

195
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't know what I'm doing, basically. 

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,160
This is the danger point for me, folding these are taking for ever... 

197
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,480
- Right.
- I always knew this before coming into it, 

198
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,920
I'm way behind time, as per usual, 

199
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,800
so I'm trying to rush these to get them to prove. 

200
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,920
- OK, so you're just really all-out now?
- Yeah. 

201
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,200
I should've done Chelsea buns, I knew I should've done Chelsea buns! 

202
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,080
That's too many raisins, it's not going to hold together. 

203
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,000
Stop fiddling with them, or they'll just never been done, will they? 

204
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,720
Just get one little one at the end! 

205
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,080
Beautiful regional sweet dough buns 

206
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,000
aren't just made great by their place of origin, 

207
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,920
they can also make their place of origin great. 

208
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
In the West Country there's a teatime treat 

209
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,560
which is just so much more than a regional delicacy. 

210
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,640
Cornish saffron buns have actually played a major role 

211
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,560
in keeping the community together for years. 

212
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,920
In Cornwall during the early 19th century, 

213
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,920
a Methodist tradition was founded that sought 

214
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,600
to curb the problem of local workers getting drunk on their days off. 

215
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,200
Men were encouraged to sign teetotal pledges, 

216
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,400
and on special holy days, events known as Tea Treat days 

217
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,120
became a much anticipated date in the Cornish calendar. 

218
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,360
The Cornish Tea Treat was one of the highlights of the year, 

219
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,240
everybody really looked forward to it. 

220
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,160
There was tremendous anticipation 

221
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,720
and the procession was a big day. 

222
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,840
Everybody gathered round the chapel first thing in the morning, 

223
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,640
the brass band would start up, the banner would be hoisted, 

224
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,080
and then you were on your way. 

225
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,960
And some of these processions, they went on for ages! 

226
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,440
It snaked round the little tiny Cornish narrow streets. 

227
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,800
And the whole reason that they were going out was 

228
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,680
because when Jesus ascended to Heaven, 

229
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,400
the Disciples go out on the streets at Pentecost 

230
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,120
and tell people the good news. 

231
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,720
So this was all linked in with telling the good news about Christ. 

232
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,360
But for many, the most exciting part of the Tea Treat days 

233
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,440
were the delicious sweet Cornish saffron buns 

234
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,800
that marked the culmination of this joyous parade. 

235
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,440
Usually about lunchtime, they'd make their way 

236
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,560
to a field, or to a big house, 

237
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,560
and the great feature was the Tea Treat bun. 

238
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,680
There'd be big trestle tables and they'd be stacked up. 

239
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,880
Every child would get one, they were packed full of fruit 

240
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,440
and children absolutely adored them. 

241
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,360
The Tea Treat bun was a most marvellous thing, 

242
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,720
and the Cornish folk'd say, "Get a Tea Treat bun as big as your head." 

243
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,160
The saffron that makes these buns so delicious and colourful 

244
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,200
was originally brought to these shores by Venetian traders 

245
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,160
over 2,000 years ago, bartered for the locally mined tin. 

246
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,320
And this iconic bake has since become a firm favourite 

247
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,640
in the kitchens and bakeries of Cornwall. 

248
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,680
Well, I've been making these Cornish saffron buns for about ten years. 

249
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,080
The recipe's been passed on by my mum and my grandmother, 

250
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,240
and I've sort of adapted it a bit to myself. 

251
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,000
They're made with sultanas, currants, mixed peel 

252
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,360
and saffron steeped in water. 

253
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,280
I remember when I was a young girl going to Sunday School treats, 

254
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,160
usually down on Carbis Bay beach, and at the end of the day 

255
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,640
you'd really look forward to having 

256
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,920
one of these great big buns given to you. 

257
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,400
In fact, they were usually so big you couldn't eat them all. 

258
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,440
The heyday of the Tea Treat parades is remembered with great fondness, 

259
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,840
their success due in large part to that much-loved main attraction, 

260
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,040
the delicious and unique Cornish saffron bun. 

261
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,800
OK, you bun-loving criminals, you've got 30 minutes left! 

262
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,400
Oh, good luck, little buns, good luck! There you go, then, there you go. 

263
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,320
They'll take 20 minutes to bake 

264
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,560
and then I've just got to put a bun wash on top, 

265
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,520
which will be about three minutes, 

266
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,280
and turn them out and out them onto this basket... 

267
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,680
with a minute-and-a-half to spare. 

268
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,600
The high amount of sugar and butter in the buns 

269
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,240
means there's a greater chance they'll burn, 

270
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,880
so deciding when to remove them from the oven is crucial. 

271
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,120
BEEPING 

272
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,960
That's the one. 

273
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,760
They're absolutely huge! 

274
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,520
I'm quite pleased with them, actually. 

275
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,920
I'm loving this sugar. 

276
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,400
SHE GASPS 

277
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,520
Whoops! 

278
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
They're robust, we're all right. 

279
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh! 

280
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,520
OK. Lucky seven, you have 15 minutes left, 

281
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,560
so get your buns into gear - you've 15 minutes left. 

282
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Hah! 

283
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,520
It's ten minutes? 

284
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,560
OK. 

285
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,960
Pants. 

286
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,200
Oh, come on! 

287
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,360
Oh, pants! 

288
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,440
These look awful. Why are they not...? 

289
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,920
What's wrong with them? 

290
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,880
I've practised all week at home with these... 

291
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,280
I don't know... 

292
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,040
But I think I won't be here much longer than another 48 hours. 

293
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,480
You've got one minute left to go. 

294
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,760
One minute. 

295
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,520
You've just got to go for it, haven't you? 

296
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,120
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. 

297
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,480
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9... 

298
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,400
I've got no space. 

299
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,760
Aw! 

300
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,760
Put that there. 

301
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,320
What's done is done and cannot be undone. 

302
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,640
OK, bakers, it's time up. 

303
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,160
Step away. Brendan! Time is up. 

304
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,400
Get your hands off your buns. I mean it! 

305
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,160
They all look pretty good, right size... 

306
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,360
All different colours, which is interesting. 

307
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,600
You can see when you look into it that the bottom of it is quite tight, 

308
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,600
- and that's down to being under-proved.
- OK. 

309
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,320
I think they taste really good, but I could have done with 

310
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,880
more cream in there, 

311
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,480
- and more of your homemade strawberry jam.
- Mm.
- It was lovely. 

312
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,120
I think, just more filling. 

313
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,360
But you have got some burnt ones and some light ones. 

314
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,800
"Burnt" is maybe a bit harsh. 

315
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,840
I think they're a little bit under-proved, to be honest. 

316
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,240
- Actually, the structure looks all right.
- Does it?
- Yeah. 

317
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,400
I could do with a little bit more flavour in there. 

318
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,920
- A bit bland.
- Is it bland?
- Mmm.
- OK. 

319
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,160
Did you put almond extract, as well as...? 

320
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,640
No, I forgot. I was meant to. 

321
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,600
- There you are.
- That's why. 

322
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,280
These are for good appetites, aren't they? 

323
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,400
It's a good, consistent bake. 

324
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,680
They're a nice size - I like the size. 

325
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,240
I like the icing on the top. They look great. 

326
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,840
Sheer heaven to eat, I can tell you. 

327
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,640
True almond flavour coming through. 

328
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,440
You've put lots in there. You've managed to let it not leak out. 

329
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,680
That's a Bakewell tart, in a roll. 

330
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,200
That's what I was hoping to do. 

331
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,120
They taste wonderful. 

332
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,320
- Thank you very much. 
- SUE: Great buns, Danny! 

333
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,120
- Oh!
- That's good texture. 

334
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,360
That texture is excellent. 

335
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,880
I can't argue with the bake on that. 

336
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,920
It's lovely and soft, isn't it? I mean, it tempts you. 

337
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,600
I like the sugariness on top. Lovely. 

338
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,480
- They taste great. 
- The silverback is silent. 

339
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,080
- Well done, Ryan.
- Thank you. 
- Well done. 

340
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,040
They are...very, very good. 

341
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,600
- MARY: And a lot of them were. 
- Lovely taste. 

342
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,440
It's interesting and it's daring to use wholemeal on this sort of thing. 

343
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,760
The problem is, the filling itself, it's never going to bind. 

344
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,480
You can unravel it. 

345
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,360
It's not good enough as a binder in a bun, cos you expect that to hold together. 

346
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,680
Consistency in the bake isn't particularly good, 

347
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,240
I'm getting a hell of a crust on this one. 

348
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,120
It's a lovely flavour. 

349
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,800
The nutmeg is coming through strongly, but I rather like that. 

350
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,480
Otherwise, they'd be very bland. 

351
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,680
These look quite dainty buns... 

352
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,160
with your candy on the top. 

353
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,320
- You see the interior, when I push it...and it holds?
- OK. 

354
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,000
It's an indication that they're a bit under-proved. 

355
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,360
- It's a little bit dry...
- OK.
- ..and a little bit lacking in flavour. 
- Is it really?! 

356
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,920
- My goodness!
- That's a bit of a shame. 

357
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,040
- Sorry.
- Thank you, Sarah-Jane. 

358
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,640
The structure inside that looks quite good. 

359
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,320
Yeah, it looks quite light. 

360
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,960
It does look lovely and light. 

361
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,520
It's very even and holding together. 

362
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,640
I think those taste rather good. 

363
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,680
The texture of the dough 

364
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,240
is really lovely. 

365
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,840
It's so soft 

366
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,440
and totally original, isn't it? 

367
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,360
Well done. Nice texture, good bake. 

368
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,760
- SUE:
- Congratulations-ski! 

369
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,920
Really unusual and delicious. 

370
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,120
- Thank you.
- Thank you. 

371
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,920
The judges were very pleased with the bake, especially Paul - he was very complimentary. 

372
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,760
This is the normal routine now - I do well with the first bake, 

373
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,880
then Technical Challenge puts me right at the bottom again 

374
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,200
and I'm back in danger again, and I'm fighting for my life for tomorrow. 

375
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,280
Didn't go very well, really. Paul and Mary both said that 

376
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,360
there wasn't any flavour to it. 

377
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,080
It tastes better than the ones 

378
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,200
I've made at home, or just as good, at least, yeah? 

379
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,960
So I'm gutted, I'm proper gutted. 

380
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,640
They didn't really like them. 

381
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,880
Bit of a flop, really. 

382
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,920
As Mary said, there are two more challenges to go. Don't count yourself out yet, love! 

383
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,840
The surprise element of the next task can leave a baker in a precarious position. 

384
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,440
It's the Technical Challenge. 

385
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,120
As you all know with this challenge, 

386
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,920
Paul and Mary judge it blind, 

387
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,360
so, Paul and Mary, with the deepest respect... 

388
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,360
- off you go. Tatty-byes.
- Bye. 

389
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,400
Today, for your Technical Challenge, 

390
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,560
what we'd like you to make... 

391
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,200
are jam doughnuts. 

392
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,880
Now, Mary and Paul are looking for a batch of ten doughnuts, please, from each of you. 

393
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,040
And they're not only looking for consistency in size, 

394
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,240
but also in jam distribution and colour. 

395
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,400
You've got two-and-a-half hours. All the very best. On your marks... 

396
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,600
- Get set.
- BOTH: Bake! 

397
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,800
It's believed that doughnuts originated in Holland, 

398
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,040
where they're known as "oliekoek"... 

399
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,400
which means "oil cake". 

400
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,080
Oh, I'm very experienced with doughnuts(!) Well, I eat them! 

401
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,880
Wow! Those look absolute whoppers! 

402
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,800
Now, the dough is quite soft. 

403
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,360
They won't be quite sure 

404
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,920
what the consistency should be. 

405
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,160
Of course, if it's dry, 

406
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,200
it won't give a lovely texture. 

407
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,560
If it's too wet, they won't be able to handle it. 

408
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,320
Excuse fingers, Mary. 

409
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,040
Gosh, there's a lot of jam in there. 

410
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,680
You've got to make sure that inside that doughnut 

411
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,640
is cooked properly. 

412
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,880
If the fry is too high, 

413
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,400
if the mix is too dense, 

414
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,080
the inside of those doughnuts will be raw. 

415
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,080
Firstly, the bakers mix together flour, butter, yeast, sugar, 

416
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,760
salt and water to make a wet, enriched dough 

417
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,240
I haven't a clue what I'm doing, at all. Not a clue. 

418
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:17,120
Making doughnuts is new to all of the bakers except James. 

419
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,000
These are a very regular thing. Made them many, many times. 

420
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,320
This one should be all right, I hope. 

421
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,200
Feeling a little bit stressed, to be honest. 

422
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,640
A little bit frightened. SHE LAUGHS 

423
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,000
Just need to get on with it, really, I think. 

424
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,720
Just need to get over it, get on with it. 

425
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,000
I know what the end product should look like, 

426
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,760
so, as Technical challenges go, 

427
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,720
this isn't too bad, I think. 

428
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,480
Oh! I'm going to eat... 

429
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,000
Why did I say that? I'm going to eat my own words. 

430
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,160
Oh! Interesting dough. 

431
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,760
To achieve a light, spongy doughnut texture, 

432
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,160
the dough must be very moist, 

433
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,840
making it difficult to knead. 

434
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,680
It's important the bakers work the dough well 

435
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,760
to create essential air pockets, 

436
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,600
enabling it to rise. 

437
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,000
This looks disgusting at the moment. 

438
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,800
If I work it properly, it will stop being disgusting. 

439
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,720
I don't know how it's supposed to be going at this point. 

440
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,800
But this just seems really weird. 

441
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:21,240
It's just like kneading a big ball of chewing gum. 

442
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,640
This should be in... 

443
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,920
This should be in the proving drawer, proving, really, 

444
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,440
with the timeframe we've got. 

445
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,120
HE SIGHS 

446
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,600
They say that an army marches on its stomach. 

447
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,200
Well, for American servicemen, 

448
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,120
one item of food in particular was guaranteed to boost their morale. 

449
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,920
Yes, that winning combination of a perma-tanned dolly and a freshly baked doughnut 

450
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,960
was all it took to really raise a GI's spirits. 

451
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,760
In 1942, if you were a homesick American soldier on British soil, 

452
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,760
a service club was the place to be. 

453
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,320
Here, servicemen could let their hair down, socialise and feel at home. 

454
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,960
And the key to the success of the whole evening 

455
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,480
was the good old American doughnut. 

456
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,960
So, the idea started in the First World War. 

457
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,240
The Salvation Army decided to give the American soldiers a taste 

458
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,840
of home and a boost of morale, so they decided to make them doughnuts. 

459
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,000
The idea was such a success that the American Red Cross made it central 

460
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,080
to their entertaining of the troops in the Second World War. 

461
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,800
Venues, called "service clubs" were set up near US Army bases, 

462
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,280
and American girls, known as "doughnut dollies" 

463
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,000
were hired to entertain the troops and serve up their favourite snack. 

464
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,360
They flirted with the men. 

465
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,600
They chatted to them, they provided an ear to listen to, 

466
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,560
and earned this affectionate nickname. 

467
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,400
The service clubs were all about good, wholesome fun, 

468
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,760
and the doughnut dollies had to abide by a strict set of guidelines on how to behave. 

469
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,800
They always had to be happy, they had to be always well groomed, 

470
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,040
they couldn't have a lazy no make-up day. 

471
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,360
They had to be intelligent and to be good-looking. 

472
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,240
A lot of them were very well educated, and some of them had degrees. 

473
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,040
They had to be able to hold conversation and, most of all, 

474
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,680
be charming. 

475
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,800
The dollies and their doughnuts were such a huge hit with the US troops 

476
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,080
that a way of reaching more Army bases around Britain was needed. 

477
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,680
Old Green Line buses were transformed into "clubmobiles" - 

478
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,240
a service club on wheels. Run by the dollies, 

479
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,840
they dispensed doughnuts by the truckload. 

480
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,080
In June 1944, American forces were preparing to invade Northern France, 

481
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,400
and alongside the tanks and armoured cars, 

482
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,800
another vehicle was being prepared to cope with the war-torn terrain of Continental Europe. 

483
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,800
Nearly a hundred 2.5-tonne troop carriers were converted into clubmobiles, 

484
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,560
and the doughnut dollies had to ready themselves to enter a war zone. 

485
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,800
The hostesses, they were given instructions into 

486
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,880
how to keep the trucks running, 

487
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,880
maintenance, in case they broke down. 

488
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,720
In the layout of the clubmobile, it was a giant doughnut machine, 

489
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,120
so everything was fresh, being served up. 

490
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,880
The doughnuts weren't your supermarket doughnut that you get nowadays. 

491
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,160
They were hand cut and thrown into a deep-fat fryer. 

492
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,680
Sometimes they were a bit burnt, sometimes they were a bit undercooked. 

493
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,960
They weren't always round. You were lucky if you got a hole in the middle. 

494
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,480
But the GIs didn't mind their doughnuts a bit rough and ready, 

495
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,120
and the clubmobile convoy advanced right across Europe, until victory was secured 

496
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,200
on May 7th 1945. 

497
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,320
During World War II, the Red Cross purchased enough flour 

498
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,080
to make 1.6 billion doughnuts, 

499
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,720
eventually serving them at a rate of 400 per minute. 

500
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,920
These heroic doughnut dollies could be proud 

501
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:47,920
that they had well and truly won the battle for the hearts, minds and stomachs 

502
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,160
of the grateful American soldiers. 

503
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,240
One hour left, you doughnuts! 

504
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,400
The judges are looking for consistent size and shape, 

505
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,360
so the bakers must be neat and accurate when portioning out their doughnuts. 

506
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,640
It's the most satisfying thing in the world. 

507
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,960
That is no exaggeration. The most satisfying thing in the world 

508
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,040
is putting a bit of bread dough on the scales, 

509
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:16,160
and it's exactly the weight you want it to be. Yes! 

510
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,640
So, you get all the bad stuff in one place, 

511
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,520
and that brings some tension on the side. 

512
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,360
Then, when you put it on the counter, 

513
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,720
and you just roll it round in the palm of your hand, 

514
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,640
it will form a lovely smooth ball. 

515
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,920
I'm just going by how I would normally shape bread, 

516
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,080
kind of just tucking it all round 

517
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,440
and trying to make it into as ball-y a shape as possible, 

518
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,400
and try and keep it so that it doesn't hit the oil and kind of just go, pfft. 

519
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,400
The second proving is paramount to the success of the doughnuts. 

520
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,160
Rather than cooking in the oven, they're deep-fried, 

521
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,160
so this is their last chance to rise. 

522
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,160
That'll stop it drying out, and they can prove a bit. 

523
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,360
The bakers need to make ten doughnuts. 

524
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,000
They risk running out of time if they leave the dough in the proving drawer for too long. 

525
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,640
I would be the first person in the oil. 

526
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,080
Maybe I should just take the oily plunge. 

527
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,800
Why not? 

528
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,800
Oh, my Lord, that's not right, is it? 

529
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,520
Oh, my giddy aunt... Agh! 

530
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,520
First in the fryer. 

531
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,560
I think this is big enough. I can't cope with them any bigger. 

532
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,720
They're like big beasts, aren't they? 

533
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,440
I'm going to go for it. 

534
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,480
I wonder how much you can disguise with a whole heap of caster sugar. 

535
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,040
Timing is key when frying doughnuts. 

536
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,480
They're in danger of being undercooked or burnt to a crisp. 

537
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,320
Not going on times, I'm just going on the colour that they are, 

538
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:11,320
the kind of colour that I imagine a doughnut to be, 

539
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,120
so kind of like a dark golden brown. 

540
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,080
Oh, we're off, we've got bubbles. 

541
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,120
That's how you know how brown they're supposed to be, 

542
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,080
because they flip over. 

543
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,760
I must be seriously below the standard of the rest 

544
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,680
if I don't do well in this challenge 

545
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,000
because I've done it so many times before. 

546
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,200
These are looking quite brown. 

547
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,400
Very, very brown, actually, 

548
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,600
so I'm just going to get these ones out. 

549
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,720
Oh hello, another technical challenge! 

550
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,600
I made a really wet dough and it kind of went flat. 

551
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,200
Maybe that's it. I'm... Don't know. 

552
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,760
Once fried, the bakers need to immediately coat their doughnuts in caster sugar... 

553
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,680
..then leave them to cool before filling them with jam. 

554
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,480
Haemorrhaging slightly! 

555
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,720
They need to be jammy, though, don't they? They're doughnuts. 

556
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,320
- I think you might've got some kind of...
- Got a blockage! 

557
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,440
..a jam...literally a jam. 

558
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,720
- Ooh, there we go.
- No! That's sorted now. 

559
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,000
- Got rid of that one.
- Certainly did. 

560
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,600
- You're certainly the neatest of the jam injectors, and I've seen all of them.
- Have you? 

561
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,120
- You've got a very neat syringe. 
- Thank you very much, Mel. It's nice to be appreciated for once. 

562
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,720
No, it's good, it's good. 

563
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,840
They feel quite doughy inside. I don't even know if they're cooked. 

564
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,560
# This is not my favourite! # 

565
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,280
Ten minutes, please, bakers! Ten minutes left. 

566
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,480
Frantic fry time. 

567
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,720
SHE SIGHS 

568
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,920
Little bit worried. In technical challenges, when things go wrong, all I want to do is just finish it. 

569
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,080
You've got one minute left to go. 

570
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,040
Doom is what's going through my mind. Doughnut doom! 

571
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,680
Think they're pretty good. 

572
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,400
OK, bakers, that's it. Doughnut time is up. 

573
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,680
Mary and Paul have no idea which baker made which batch of doughnuts. 

574
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,960
This will only be revealed once they've made their final judgment. 

575
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,640
What we're looking for in a good doughnut is the light colour, 

576
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,360
cooked inside and a good amount of jam. 

577
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,200
Now, the problem with these is, they've been over-proved, 

578
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,000
and it's flattened as you've moved it to the fat fryer. 

579
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,520
I think they were pretty much crepes when they went in there. Want to have a go at that one, Mary? 

580
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,760
- It's sort of under... It's chewy. 
- Hmm. 

581
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,600
It's sticking together. It's doughy. 

582
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,040
That is technically underdone. 

583
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,400
A good lot of jam in there, though. 

584
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,480
That one is not bad, but it is under-proved again. 

585
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,600
As Paul is pressing the dough down, it's sticking. 

586
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,360
But the shape of them aren't bad. 

587
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,160
Interesting. 

588
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,360
I mean, they've been overdone 

589
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,440
and it's been in there a little bit too long. 

590
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,280
That's not bad, that, at all. 

591
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:03,320
It's got a bounce on it, it is cooked, good jam inside, 

592
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,960
- good colour. 
- That means it's very nice. 

593
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,160
These aren't too bad either. 

594
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,160
Lots of jam inside. 

595
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,280
They are cooked inside, good bit of jam, nice and equal in colour. 

596
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,760
(They do look perfect. They've come out nice.) 

597
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,760
These are raw inside. 

598
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,160
Not long enough in the... 

599
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,840
It just looks dough, and you can see the sort of stretch marks on it. 

600
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,640
You can still see the dough inside. 

601
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,360
OK, it's going to be a tricky one, this one. 

602
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,320
Mary and Paul must grade the doughnuts, starting with the worst. 

603
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:51,800
So, the person in seventh place is this one at the end. 

604
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,720
It's raw inside. 

605
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,240
And in sixth place, 

606
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,000
it's this one here, 

607
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,680
and they're over-proved, so they've come up and dropped down again. 

608
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,600
They're very flat. 

609
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,160
And in fifth place is this one. 

610
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,520
Cathryn, again, needed a bit longer, and a bit irregular, as well. 

611
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,920
They've gone a bit flat. 

612
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,320
And these, although they look nice and jammy, 

613
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,200
when they were pinched it wasn't quite done. 

614
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,800
Third place is this one. 

615
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,880
Moistness inside wasn't too bad, but very close, these two. 

616
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,600
And in second place, 

617
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,200
looking very good, lots of jam, nice bake, but not quite as good 

618
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,560
as number one. 

619
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,600
And number one is this one. Well done. 

620
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,640
- That's a pretty good selling doughnut. Well done. 
- SUE: Well done, James. Nice one. 

621
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,120
That was just sheer luck that it was doughnuts. I actually feel a bit bad. 

622
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:54,200
I feel like...almost like I've cheated the bakers out of a first place. 

623
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,080
They looked perfect, and he didn't mention that at all. 

624
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,640
He didn't mention that they were a nice colour. It was just, "This is raw." 

625
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,720
I didn't do too well, but at one point, I thought, "I'll be last," 

626
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,320
so in a sense, I'm really happy. It's almost like a victory! 

627
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,880
The Showstopper Challenge is the final hurdle for the bakers. 

628
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,480
Two will be leaving this week, 

629
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,000
so they need to display perfection in their bake. 

630
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:39,520
So, bakers, as if today's hard work was not enough for you, 

631
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,600
we're going to push on through straightaway to the Showstopper Challenge. 

632
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,040
Now this, of course, is the challenge that stands between you 

633
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,520
and a place in the quarter-final. 

634
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,120
We're going to ask you, please, to make a celebratory enriched dough loaf, the like of which you see 

635
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:02,080
- often in festivities around the world. Christmas.
- Twelfth Night. 
- Easter and my birthday. 

636
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,000
We know it takes a long time to get that dough going, so very best of luck. 

637
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,360
- On your marks...
- Get set... BOTH:
- ..Bake! 

638
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,040
Proving the dough can take up to 12 hours, 

639
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,840
so the bakers start the process at the end of today. 

640
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,400
Four have chosen to prove theirs overnight. 

641
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,080
When I normally do this dough, I'm normally making it at Christmas time, 

642
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,800
and I put it in my outer hall, set it off on a Friday night, 

643
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,240
and I come to it on Saturday morning and it's been absolutely fine. 

644
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,440
But that's my outer hall in winter, this is my tent in the summer. 

645
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,840
Enriched celebratory loaves range from French brioche to German stollen. 

646
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:46,960
The eggs, butter and sugar give the loaves their rich flavours and soft textures. 

647
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:55,200
I do want to see a bit of originality, and even though it's going to look spectacular, 

648
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,680
it's got to taste really something special. 

649
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,800
To make a celebration bread using an enriched dough is tricky. Timing is crucial. 

650
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,560
Whoever decides to do it overnight will probably have more of an intense flavour in their bread. 

651
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:13,200
The ones that don't, really have to compensate by adding flavour to their enriched dough. 

652
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,560
Not everyone is proving their dough overnight. 

653
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,520
Brendan, Sarah-Jane and Ryan have chosen to prepare their fillings instead. 

654
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,920
Sour cherries and golden sultanas, 

655
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,640
and they're going to be soaked in some orange juice. 

656
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,920
I'm using the flavourings from my Christmas stollen, 

657
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,080
but I'm putting it into a brioche dough. 

658
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,160
Danny's creating a European Christmas wreath 

659
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,320
with an orange curd filling. 

660
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,720
When I did it at home, I did it in the morning, went to work, 

661
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,440
came back and it was 14 hours after I'd started it and it was fine. 

662
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,720
What I'm going to do here is something very similar. 

663
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,880
Brioche dough is proved in a cool environment for at least 12 hours. 

664
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,880
This gives the bread flavour and also solidifies the butter, 

665
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,320
making it easier to shape. 

666
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:12,920
James and John have chosen to make a sponge starter. 

667
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,400
This technique combines yeast, milk and flour to form a mother dough 

668
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,400
that the other ingredients will later be added to. 

669
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,000
This creates a slower rise, yielding greater depth of flavour. 

670
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,800
I'm going to bake a baba. 

671
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,800
My plan is to make a sponge, 

672
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,360
a lovely, lovely little sponge for tomorrow. 

673
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,560
James's sponge should give his baba flavour, 

674
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,960
but to help it on its way, he's also adding soaked raisins and jelly, 

675
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,400
flavoured with his favourite tipple. 

676
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,280
Paul doesn't like very much alcohol in things, 

677
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,280
so this has got, you know, half a bottle of whisky in. 

678
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,720
Totally silly of me to do it, I'm sure. It is controversial. 

679
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,360
It rests on my flavour combination. 

680
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,960
If I can't deliver and I can't get the technical side of it right, then I could be going. 

681
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,880
Mindful that Paul and Mary labelled his signature Chelsea buns as bland, 

682
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,720
John is hoping his sponge starter technique will enhance 

683
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,040
the flavour of his marzipan stollen. 

684
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:18,240
It'll give it that sort of depth and that good, malty flavour, almost, which is what we want. 

685
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,360
Good luck, little sponge. 

686
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,560
Sleep well. 

687
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:47,160
Four of the bakers left their doughs and sponge starters to prove overnight. 

688
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,280
If the dough has not successfully risen, 

689
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,000
then they'll need to start from scratch. 

690
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,480
It looks all right. 

691
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,200
I'm going to let it come to room temperature, 

692
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,400
cos I don't want to shock it by putting it straight from cold to warm. 

693
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,920
So I am pleased with this. 

694
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,600
It's proved a little bit, but not a massive amount, 

695
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,200
so I'm going to put it in the proving drawer and get on with everything else now. 

696
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,720
Using a sponge starter dough creates more flavour in the final bake. 

697
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,800
Just feels really, really cold. It feels almost frozen, to be honest, 

698
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,440
so I'm just going to have to bin this. 

699
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,920
This sponge I made last night, I needed to get it out the fridge earlier, 

700
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,720
and so it's not come to temperature quick enough 

701
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,880
and so the reaction of the two different heats has just made a really stiff mess. 

702
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,320
So I'm going to have to bin it and not do a sponge now. 

703
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,920
So I'm quite gutted. All that sponge for nothing. 

704
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,960
John will now need to make a standard enriched dough 

705
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,320
and add more flavours to compensate. 

706
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,840
It's not going to affect the rising time of my dough, or anything like that. 

707
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,000
It's just this time now is just a bit of waste of time. 

708
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,080
But, you know, these things do happen. 

709
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,880
I'm just... 

710
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,640
At the moment, I'm rubbing the butter into the flour and the sugar 

711
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,840
and the salt, just to try and get it all the way through 

712
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,560
so that it's all mixed in. 

713
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:12,920
Sarah-Jane's Signature Bake was criticised for being bland and under-proved, 

714
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,280
while her doughnuts were raw inside. 

715
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,280
But she's hoping to win back favour 

716
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,480
with her six-strand plaited Christmas loaf. 

717
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,040
- So two strands are chocolate flavoured...
- OK. 

718
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,240
..two strands are cherry flavoured... 

719
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,320
- Got you.
- ..two strands are marzipan. 

720
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,520
How are you going to do it? Outside in? Or...? 

721
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,320
Over two, under one, over two. 

722
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:37,480
- Yeah, you're lacing it through. 
- Yes.
- All right, Sarah-Jane, good luck.
- Happy plaiting.
- Thank you. 

723
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,200
- Morning, Brendan. 
- Morning, Brendan.
- Good morning. 

724
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,800
Is it a '70s delight today, or is something more in the '80s? 

725
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,560
It's going to be a Black Forest Christmas stollen, 

726
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:58,960
so I see it as a sort of centrepiece for a Christmas buffet table, 

727
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,760
- which would allow for some additional decoration.
- Very good, so it is '70s. 

728
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,800
Brendan is shaping his Black Forest stollen in a Bundt tin, 

729
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,880
decorating it with marzipan sweets that traditionally represent 

730
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,960
the 12 Apostles, minus Judas. 

731
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,720
I know they say '70s, but I think I'm a great bridge between the '70s and today, 

732
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,280
so I'm giving the '70s a modern twist. 

733
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,560
I hope he heard that! 

734
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,080
While the doughs are proving, the bakers finish preparing their fillings and flavours. 

735
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:37,080
This is just the marzipan going through the stollen. 

736
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,600
I'm going to wrap the cherries into it with some chocolate, 

737
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,600
and then roll it up into a tube and then put that inside it. 

738
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,720
I'm trying to fight for my place here in the competition, 

739
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,000
and that's why I'm stuffing a piece of marzipan with cherries and chocolate. 

740
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,320
- Is that not a bit risky? Have you tried it out?
- No, it is risky, but it's the idea to... 

741
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,520
I need something inside of it, it's a stollen. 

742
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,240
I want them to dissect it and get cherry with chocolate round it. 

743
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,920
- But you've just invented this?
- Yeah. I'm not going to back down and play it safe 

744
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,440
- because I'm in a dangerous position. 
- No, good.
- I'm taking a risk! 
- Come out fighting. 

745
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,280
Ryan's doughnut disaster in the technical round 

746
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,760
means he'll need to produce a winning Showstopper. 

747
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,240
Ryan, we have come at a crucial moment. 

748
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,040
- You are the only person doing a savoury.
- That's right. 

749
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,480
I thought I'd do something Chinese. 

750
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,160
He's making a Char Siu Bao, which is a roast pork loaf 

751
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,280
traditionally given at Chinese New Year. 

752
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,880
I've made some sauce with it. 

753
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,000
I'm going to chop up the meat, put it in the sauce 

754
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,840
and stick it into the bread. 

755
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:41,120
- I've never had one before, so I'm looking forward to it. 
- I love a pork bun. 

756
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,640
- It's a first. 
- I hope you enjoy it.
- Thanks. 

757
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:50,400
I'm making little mini brioches with a head on, which the French call a brioches a tete. 

758
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,200
You pull it, stretch its neck as thinly as you possibly can, 

759
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,920
squidge it down. 

760
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:02,520
Sometimes it can get a bit drunken and look like a drunken...seaman. 

761
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,360
Cathryn is also making a brioche, 

762
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,880
which she has named Bonfire Tear 'N' Share 

763
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,360
with a cream cheese frosting. 

764
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,480
- Can I have a look at it, please? 
- Really? 

765
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,160
Yes, I'd like to look at the dough. 

766
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,680
- Is it a chocolate brioche? 
- No, it's got lots of cinnamon in it. 

767
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,000
LOTS of cinnamon to make it go that dark. 

768
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,040
- OK, good luck, Cathryn.
- Thanks. 

769
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,920
Paul has frightened me a little bit 

770
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,520
about the amount of cinnamon that's in the dough. 

771
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,480
I don't know, it might be a mistake. 

772
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,960
It's like an enormous cornea. So this is agar and whisky? 

773
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,400
- Yes.
- Basically whisky jelly. Can I eat this? 

774
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,240
That might not be very delicious. If you try this one, it might be. 

775
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,000
Goodness, that is strong. 

776
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,880
- Whoo!
- That is strong. 

777
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,200
LAUGHTER 

778
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,560
That is strong. 

779
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:11,600
I'm now gathering all the dried fruits together, that have soaked overnight. 

780
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,960
I'm going to knead them into the dough. 

781
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,080
There you go, and bake it. 

782
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,480
OK, chocolate, cherry, marzipan. 

783
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,800
Chocolate, cherry, marzipan. 

784
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,200
Over two... 

785
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,200
..under one. 

786
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,760
- You are plaiting again, you loon! 
- I know. 

787
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,000
- A sucker for punishment. 
- Well, no, you see, 

788
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,400
I feel like I haven't progressed very much. 

789
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,680
I thought I'd quite like to show 

790
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,840
that I am interested and that I can do stuff. 

791
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,000
Course you can, you've been in The Bake Off for seven weeks! 

792
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,160
- I know.
- Of course you can, you can do everything!
- I know. 

793
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,280
- You've got one major challenge still to do.
- I know, but I don't think my loaf is spectacular enough 

794
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,160
to bring it back. 

795
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,120
Over two, under one, over two. 

796
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,280
Over two, under one, over two. 

797
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,440
BOTH: Over two, under one, over two. 

798
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,880
Tuck the bottom in. 

799
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,280
And poke it all in. 

800
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,880
Good luck, loaf. 

801
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,080
Good luck. 

802
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:20,040
The bakers have reached their sixth and final proving of the weekend. 

803
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,880
Enriched loaves are best baked at a low temperature 

804
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,720
to prevent the surface from browning before the interior has set. 

805
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,280
OK, bakers, you should all have buns in the oven. 

806
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,160
You know what? I'm not going to watch it, 

807
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,960
I'm going to wait till the timer bips, then switch 

808
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,280
the temperature down a little and then try not to just sit and...stare. 

809
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,880
I don't know if it's over-proved or not because I always make my bread 

810
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,240
really, really soft. I might be in a bit of trouble 

811
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,200
because that happened to me in the doughnut round yesterday, 

812
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,480
and if he believes they're over-proved again, 

813
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,160
you know, he'll say this is a constant mistake, so, you know... 

814
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:16,480
It's a nice colour, and it's... 

815
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,080
and it's puffed up quite a lot, so hopefully it's proved enough. 

816
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,520
I'd like to make ONE thing this weekend that they like. 

817
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,960
OK, that's 30 minutes remaining, everybody, just 30 minutes. 

818
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,840
Oh, dear! 

819
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,160
That's good. 

820
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,840
It's not risen as much as it does at home. 

821
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,800
It rises loads at home. 

822
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,080
What a mess. 

823
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,280
Beautiful. 

824
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,760
- Please tell me you are going to dust that with icing sugar.
- Liberally. 

825
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,720
Oh, it's going to be beautiful! 

826
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,880
A wee bit dark. That's a shame. 

827
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,440
Oh, look, it's shrinking. 

828
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,480
LAUGHS Oh, it's kind of split a bit. 

829
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,040
The sides look nice though. 

830
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,360
Phew! 

831
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,760
No, not good. 

832
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,360
I'm in trouble. All kinds of technical issues, 

833
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,240
it's leaking from the side. 

834
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,680
I think it's a bit dry because it's so thin. 

835
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:18,160
I hope there's a layer of good bread at the bottom, but I'm just like... 

836
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,920
maybe clutching at straws, really. 

837
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,880
The bakers only have ten minutes left to make the final touches. 

838
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,760
I want it to be messy. 

839
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,560
I'm not going for perfect. 

840
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:41,520
It looks all right, but... I've done the best I can. 

841
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,000
OK, bakers, you've got five minutes left. 

842
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,480
Very close to the end now. 

843
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,480
Got a little, er... 

844
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,160
a little... 

845
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,120
problem here. 

846
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,280
That's a bit annoying. 

847
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,760
OK, bakers, time's up. 

848
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,760
Put your sweet, doughy buns at the end of your table. 

849
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,440
It's too pale, it feels a bit dense. 

850
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,480
Um... 

851
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,560
Oh, God, I'm really disappointed with that bake. 

852
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,480
So, yeah, I think I'm quite gutted. 

853
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:44,000
I think any of us could go. I could go if that's terrible in the middle. 

854
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,680
It's what's on the inside that counts, isn't it? 

855
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,160
So we'll see when he cuts into it. 

856
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,200
Over the past seven weeks, 

857
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,920
each baker has presented 21 bakes to Mary and Paul. 

858
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:03,240
For two of them, this will be their last. 

859
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:12,040
You ticked the boxes when we said a celebration bread. 

860
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,960
I thought, seeing that dark outside, that it would be a bit hard and dry. 

861
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,480
- And it's not.
- It's a good bake. It's got great texture and flavour. 

862
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,000
- You've done really well. 
- Thank you.
- Well done, Brendan. 
- Thank you very much. 

863
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:33,400
- It does look a bit dark, it's ripped quite badly.
- Yeah, OK. 

864
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,240
- Yeah, it's raw.
- Raw?!
- Yeah. 

865
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,080
- As you chew it, it goes back to a dough.
- OK. 

866
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,760
- I think you've got the flavours right.
- Well done.
- Thanks very much. 

867
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:56,520
It doesn't have that sort of wow. It doesn't feel celebration to me. 

868
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,160
- Ooh, we have an issue.
- Yeah. 

869
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,400
Probably all the moisture coming from the meat as well. 

870
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,080
But the colour on it, it's quite pale, 

871
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,640
and as it's brioche-like, it should have been darker than that. 

872
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,960
Unfortunately, it's raw inside. 

873
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,360
The flavour of the meat is good. 

874
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,200
It was very nice you chose something totally different 

875
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,040
from everybody else and went savoury. But, for me, 

876
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,640
- it didn't quite get there.
- It's a shame. I was looking forward to it. 

877
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,480
OK. Cheers. 

878
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,600
It does look quite festive. 

879
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,000
I like what you've done with the water icing on top 

880
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,520
and it's got a nice, strong colour. 

881
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,360
The flavour's absolutely delicious. 

882
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,400
Everything you've put in there, I can still taste the flavours, 

883
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,000
which is lovely. 

884
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,240
- The flavour is excellent. Thanks, Danny.
- Well done.
- Thank you. 

885
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:52,040
Looks a little on the flat side to me. 

886
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:56,720
I mean, it actually looks... stollen-like. 

887
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,240
I find that a little bit on the stodgy side. 

888
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,040
- Very much so.
- Is it?
- Mm. 

889
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,840
It's beginning to weld my mouth together - probably not a bad thing! 

890
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,080
When you do hit the marzipan, it's lovely. 

891
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,640
It really is. 

892
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,720
CHEERING 

893
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,800
Are you trying to take our eyes out? 

894
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,120
Looks good for a bonfire, doesn't it? 

895
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,440
Looking at the colour, it looks like it's been ON the fire! 

896
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,440
- I was giving it that bonfire-y flavour.
- Ah, right. 

897
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,880
- I like the frosting on top, it's a nice idea.
- Thank you. 

898
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,960
Actually, the cinnamon's got a good balance in it. 

899
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,760
It has a lovely flavour. 

900
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,920
It's nice and sweet, the icing's good, 

901
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,200
- but it is like cutting into a cake. 
- Yeah. 

902
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,640
- You haven't got the nice aeration to it.
- OK. 

903
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,360
- Thanks, Cathryn.
- Well done. 
- Thank you.
- Well done. 

904
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:58,800
I truthfully think that the whisky-flavoured jelly is a little bit over the top. 

905
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,880
LAUGHTER 

906
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,560
The actual structure inside, it's not carrying much flavour, 

907
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,240
the crumb structure itself. 

908
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,880
Concentrate a bit more on your core flavours. 

909
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,080
'It wasn't my best bake, to be honest,' 

910
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:17,040
but the judging was reasonably positive, compared to what I was expecting. 

911
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,800
'It was a very poor bake,' 

912
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,560
probably my worst bake for this round. 

913
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,400
'Three bad bakes in a row.' 

914
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,240
It's not good. 

915
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,000
Um, so yeah, kind of just a bit... phew! 

916
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,880
'Yeah, a few people have had some tough bakes,' 

917
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,680
but I've been the least consistent. 

918
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:38,280
'There's an added pressure with two people going,' 

919
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,520
and everybody's worried and therefore clinging to the negative. 

920
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,520
This is the horrible part. 

921
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,920
Now, Mary and Paul must decide who deserves Star Baker, 

922
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,320
and agree on which two will not progress to the quarter-final. 

923
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:58,240
Let's focus on the positives. Who do we think could be Star Baker? 

924
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,920
Danny, she is quite scientific in what she does. 

925
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,320
She gets her flavours together. She had a very good bake today 

926
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,600
- and her Bakewell buns were wow. 
- They were good. 

927
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,360
- I think Brendan's up there...again. 
- The mighty Brendan. 

928
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,560
He's been unbelievable, he seems to be so constant. 

929
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:19,520
He comes up with this stuff and you go, "Wow, where did that come from?" 

930
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:24,280
Before the showstopper started, there were sort of five people that possibly 

931
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,880
could be in the danger zone. 

932
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:29,760
Cathryn, was over-baked. The flavours were good, though. 

933
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,960
I was really sad that Sarah-Jane didn't get hers cooked. 

934
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,440
That was really disappointing. 

935
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,120
James seems to be going off the plot a bit. 

936
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,760
Some of his flavours, when you get into the core of it, the texture, 

937
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,400
there isn't much there. 

938
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,160
Ryan's is, again, under-proved, under-baked. 

939
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,160
It just missed the mark. 

940
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,240
And I really didn't enjoy... 

941
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,600
- John's stollen.
- Heavy. 
- It was a stolid stollen. Two going 

942
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,680
- is going to shake them. 
- It'll hit them hard. 

943
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:06,720
Bakers, very long and emotional weekend. And luckily, 

944
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,200
I get to do the bit I really love - to reward excellence. 

945
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,320
So this week's Star Baker 

946
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,880
is someone uniquely qualified to provide intensive care 

947
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,360
to any flagging bun. 

948
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,640
- Finally, Danny is Star Baker. Well done!
- Yay! 

949
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:28,880
As you know, bakers, there will be two of you not joining us on next week's Bake Off. 

950
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,320
And I'm very sorry to say 

951
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:37,200
that the people not coming with us on our journey next week are... 

952
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,000
..Sarah-Jane... 

953
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,200
..and Ryan. 

954
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,160
We're very sorry to see you go. APPLAUSE 

955
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:57,640
Yeah, you have to come back, and you have to win. 

956
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,520
Unfortunately, Sarah-Jane had a terrible weekend. 

957
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,960
And Ryan...really disappointing. 

958
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,520
His savoury bake, it could have been wonderful. 

959
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,680
But it's very sad. 

960
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,320
My wife, I think half of her will be disappointed, 

961
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,480
half of her will be happy I won't mess up her kitchen any more 

962
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,760
with flour everywhere. Well, she's wrong. 

963
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,960
I'll carry on baking! 

964
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,760
Oh! 'I love baking in that tent.' 

965
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,120
I love the kitchen, I love the stuff. 

966
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:29,240
I love everybody else. You know, it's just been so fun. 

967
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:34,360
And I am sad to be going, but I'm also kind of, you know what, week seven? Amazing! 

968
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:41,400
'I think this weekend, even before I knew I was Star Baker, was probably the best weekends' ' 

969
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,520
baking that I've had. And so, to use the baking analogy, 

970
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,960
the Star Baker is the icing on the cake, really. It's brill. 

971
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,360
Yeah, lovely. 

972
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,400
Next time... 

973
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,200
I've burnt my first batch. 

974
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,320
..it's crunch time, as the bakers take on biscuits. 

975
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,760
I need to get cracking. 

976
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,760
They're tested with 48 signature crackers and crispbreads. 

977
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:05,600
- Don't be scared of the cracker breads.
- Oh, my gosh, I've got others in the oven, they'll be burned! 

978
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,000
A classic tea-time treat in the technical challenge. 

979
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I'm just going to torture it a bit. 

980
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,560
And a showstopper that takes gingerbread structures to the next level. 

981
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,440
This is like Meccano for boys with baking. 

982
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,240
But who will earn their place in the semi-final? 

983
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,080
Really scrummy. 

984
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,080
And who will be saying goodbye... 

985
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,160
Honestly, I've completely lost it. 

986
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,760
- Agh!
- ..to the Great British Bake Off? 

987
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,960
It's a total disaster. 

988
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,360
