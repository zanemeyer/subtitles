1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,960
So far, we've eaten a sandwich cake in the shape of an actual sandwich, 

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,280
angel food cake that tasted like the devil incarnate, 

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,240
and a chocolate shard that's made me insulin-dependent. How will we survive nine more weeks? 

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,880
More importantly, how are the bakers going to survive 

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,760
this week's challenge, and will their fingers remain intact? 

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,080
Welcome to The Great British Bake Off. 

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,760
Right. Game on. Ha! 

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,640
Last week, our baker's dozen tackled cakes. 

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,680
Oh, my God. I can't do it. 

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,920
Please don't break, please don't break. Oh! 

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,440
Oh, no! 

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,600
While the pressure of the tent was too much for some... 

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,680
Holy... 

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,000
- I'm, er, behind...
- Yep. 

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,960
- ..stressed...
- Yep. 

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,440
'..it got the better of Toby...' 

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,480
Don't try that, Mary. 

18
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,480
'..and he was the first to leave the Bake Off tent.' 

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,320
MEL WHISPERS: Oh, that looks so good! 

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,680
But others excelled... 

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,360
Success! Ha-ha! 

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,600
The overall appearance and the thought of it is exceptional. 

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,000
..and Rob was crowned this year's first Star Baker. 

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,560
APPLAUSE Fantastic. 

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,840
This week, it's Paul's passion. 

26
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,120
It's bread week, and as far as I'm concerned, 

27
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,440
it's one of the hardest things to master. 

28
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,680
Welcome to yeast. 

29
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,560
'I'll be watching them every step of the way.' 

30
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,200
There'll be no place to hide. 

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,880
I might just give it an extra few minutes, on reflection. 

32
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,680
I'll be on them like a rash. 

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,240
But who will survive... 

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,640
Arghhh! 

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,880
..and who will succumb? 

36
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,280
Oh, no! 

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,720
What will it take to stay in The Great British Bake Off? 

38
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,480
It's a Paul the Psychic Octopus tribute loaf. 

39
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,920
Of course it is. 

40
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,080
I said I wouldn't be one of those lunatics 

41
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,000
kneeling on the floor by the oven. 

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,080
And here I am. 

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,960
Um... Ooh... Er, Bohemian Bap-sidy. 

44
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,720
That's good. Um... Why Don't You Come Over...Granary? 

45
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,360
- Ohhh!
- Um... 

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,760
Er... Battenberg... 

47
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,440
- It's... It's bread week. 
- It's bread week, isn't it? 

48
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,640
Ah, bakers. Welcome back to the Bake Off tent. 

49
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,360
Now, for your Signature Bake today, please, we'd like you to make 

50
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,480
36 breadsticks. 

51
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,680
They should all be made using yeast 

52
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,440
but you can choose any flavours that you like. 

53
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,120
It's completely up to you. 

54
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,400
Now, we'd like these breadsticks to be 25cm, 

55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
or ten inches, in length. 

56
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,760
Mary and Paul are looking for a crisp, dry texture - 

57
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,440
something that you can just snap in half when you break it. 

58
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,200
A little bit like one of Paul's hair shards. 

59
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,720
You've got two hours in which to bake, so - on your marks... 

60
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,760
..get set... 

61
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,240
..bake! 

62
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,720
Breadsticks are made all over the world. 

63
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,240
They were first invented in Italy, where they're known as grissini. 

64
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,040
A breadstick is all down to the proving and the baking. 

65
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,080
The first thing we're looking for is a good snap. No bend. 

66
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,480
No chewiness. Consistency in the colour. 

67
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,320
Some will be round, some will be straight, but they've got to 

68
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,520
look professional, be original and taste good. 

69
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,600
The key ingredients for most breadsticks 

70
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,720
are flour, water and yeast. 

71
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,840
I've just added my yeast to the milk and butter. 

72
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,800
If I can be patient, I'll wait for a few bubbles. If I can't, 

73
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,880
I'll just chuck it straight in and get on with the kneading. 

74
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,560
Yeah, no - I can't be patient. 

75
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,920
OK, go. 

76
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,560
Glenn is head of sixth form at a school in Exeter 

77
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,080
and is on a mission to get all of his students baking. 

78
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,520
So try rolling that... 

79
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,720
His rosemary and Parmesan grissini are made with milk and butter. 

80
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,640
- Do you usually make grissini with butter?
- Butter, no. 

81
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,120
Olive oil? 

82
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,280
Olive oil. Butter makes things soft. You're fighting that as well. 

83
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,000
- Yeah, and the quantity of cheese does the same.
- Yeah, good luck. 

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,640
You don't make it easy for yourself, do you? 

85
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,200
One of the biggest challenges in producing the perfect breadstick 

86
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,880
is making sure it's crisp. 

87
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,720
You want to get rid of all the moisture during baking, 

88
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,160
so if you don't put it in in the first place, 

89
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,760
it's easier to get rid of - that's what I figure. 

90
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,640
Rob is a scientist who designs satellites, 

91
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,960
but his hobby is more down-to-earth - mushroom foraging. 

92
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,480
His signature breadsticks are flavoured with poppy seeds, 

93
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,960
caraway seeds and kalamata olives. 

94
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,720
I was watching your knife-work. Doesn't that look attractive? 

95
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,840
- It does.
- It's also, because I've got a thin stick, 

96
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,800
I'm going to lay them across the sticks, 

97
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,600
so that they actually stay in there, 

98
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,360
whereas if it was a lump, it might fall outside a bit more readily. 

99
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,960
So you've scientifically worked it out that in every bite... 

100
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,520
You get that flavour combination. 

101
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,720
You get your olive, all the caraway and everything. 

102
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,040
- That's the idea. 
- Marvellous. Have you counted those? 

103
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,640
Yeah - there's 47. Too many. 

104
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,160
I'll have some, then. I won't. 

105
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,640
- Thank you.
- Thanks. 

106
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,600
I'm doing a Moroccan-style breadstick. 

107
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,480
It's got preserved lemons and rosemary in the breadstick itself, 

108
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,320
and then I'm drizzling them with ras el hanout, 

109
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,000
which is a spice blend. 

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Howard is a creative baker, as well as a keen painter. 

111
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,320
Today he's experimenting 

112
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,000
with flavours inspired by a Moroccan tagine. 

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,560
How did you incorporate the lemon? That's very wet, isn't it? 

114
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,800
It is. 

115
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Do you worry that'll retard the yeast? 

116
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,720
SUE MOUTHS I don't think so. I think... 

117
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,160
I am very impressed. 

118
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,560
It's amazing what can come out of my mouth without 

119
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,120
any knowledge behind it. It's just words. It's just words. 

120
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,480
Since it's an Italian recipe, I thought I'd give it 

121
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,080
some Italian flavours. 

122
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,960
Ali works for a local marketing company in Birmingham. 

123
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,400
He's a skilled cake-maker, but baking bread is new to him. 

124
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,960
His breadsticks are flavoured with garlic, Parmesan and blue cheese. 

125
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,760
To be honest, bread isn't my forte, so, like... 

126
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,280
Don't tell him that. 

127
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,520
No, to be honest, I don't really know the science behind bread. 

128
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,400
I know what I'm doing but I don't necessarily know why I'm doing it. 

129
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,480
That's literally the story of my life, Ali. 

130
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,920
Thank you very much. Thank you. 

131
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,840
Kneading the dough is crucial to build gluten strands, 

132
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,680
but how it's done is up to the baker. 

133
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,400
This technique is about all you can do with a stiff dough. 

134
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,640
You see some of the others using the slapping technique - 

135
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,280
you wouldn't do that with this. It's too stiff. 

136
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,800
I like kneading dough. I have knocked drinks over. 

137
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,240
I have hit people in the face with dough. 

138
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,960
I don't know whether it's an accepted way of doing it or not - 

139
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,080
it's just very satisfying. 

140
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,600
I've tried a couple of different ways of kneading and I quite like this one. 

141
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,080
Since I've discovered this way of doing it... 

142
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,000
Sorry - look out for flying dough! 

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,080
..I've seen my bread improve massively. 

144
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,120
See you later. 

145
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,000
Military wife Beca keeps her husband's regiment 

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,160
regularly supplied with Beca cake. 

147
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,760
Ooh, chocolate cake! 

148
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,640
Her fennel and chilli breadsticks 

149
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,480
will be coated in semolina to give them extra crunch. 

150
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,080
Did you realise that you're wearing 

151
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,960
exactly the same top as Mary Berry today? 

152
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,800
Cos we look exactly the same. 

153
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,840
I mean, the camera men have been confused already as to who's who... 

154
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,320
Mary was here earlier - she did all my breadsticks for me 

155
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,680
while I popped out back for a cuppa, so it's all good. 

156
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,680
- She's your double.
- She is! 
- She is literally your body double. 

157
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,360
Body double! 

158
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm making Nigella seed, Parmesan and paprika breadsticks. 

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,760
They're just flavours that I really love 

160
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,320
and use quite a lot in my own baking. 

161
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,680
Kimberly says she's a flavour magpie, 

162
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,840
and regularly tries out new flavours and recipes on her flatmates. 

163
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,960
Wow. 

164
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,160
She's being meticulous about every stage of her Nigella seed 

165
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,440
and Parmesan breadsticks. 

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,360
- Hi, Kimberley. How are you doing? 
- I'm very good. 

167
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,960
I saw you looking as if through a stained glass of dough. 

168
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,160
What was all that about? 

169
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,840
I was checking for windowpane stage, to check whether 

170
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,640
the gluten is strengthened enough. 

171
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,000
You're looking for a kind of translucent, 

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,840
very, very, very thin dough that you can see the light through. 

173
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,880
Ooh. 

174
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,920
I think. 

175
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,880
Paul's looking suspicious. 

176
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,200
Good luck. Thank you. 

177
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,880
The next crucial decision is how long to prove the dough. 

178
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,600
Not long. Probably about 20 minutes. 

179
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,000
Leaving the dough for too long 

180
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,840
could result in unacceptably thick breadsticks. 

181
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,160
I saw what everyone else had done last week and I just thought, "I need to pull it out the bag. 

182
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,200
"I need to do something a little bit different." 

183
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,560
Philosophy student Ruby loves making bread 

184
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,080
and it's her mission to perfect the skill. Her breadsticks are made 

185
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,520
by entwining two separate flavoured doughs. 

186
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,920
One half of the dough has actually got the spices in 

187
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,360
and the other half in going to have all the chillies and everything in. 

188
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,600
It's going to kind of be like a candy cane. 

189
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,920
Yeah. It's how they adhere, so you've got one stiff 

190
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,360
rather than two stuck together. 

191
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,200
- They will adhere.
- OK. 
- Excellent. Cheers, Ruby. 

192
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,000
That will do nicely. 

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,360
I'm going to get them out because I want to start shaping. 

194
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,800
To ensure a perfectly even batch, precision is key, 

195
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,760
and everyone has a different approach. 

196
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,840
The pasta machine is just to give me an even thickness of dough. 

197
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,800
I'm not going to turn it into tagliatelle strips. 

198
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,800
I'm layering one on top of the other. Rolling them out together 

199
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,080
just helps them meld, so that they don't separate. 

200
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,880
I read that it was the traditional way that grissini were made - 

201
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,640
stretched rather than rolled - so I thought I' give that a go. 

202
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,720
Horticulturist Lucy likes to use things she's grown in her baking. 

203
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,840
Hoping less will be more, she's making simple grissini 

204
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,400
seasoned with sea salt. 

205
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,000
- Very plain.
- Yeah. They're simple in term of flavour 

206
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,600
but I'm hoping that they'll be technically quite good. 

207
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,640
And it's quite a wet dough, isn't that? 

208
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,440
- Are you having problems moving it? 
- Yes.
- Because, you will get 

209
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,320
some really thin bits, quite thick bits, because the dough's soft. 

210
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,800
Yeah, that's exactly the problem that I am having. 

211
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,000
- There is a way to get round that. 
- Oh...? 

212
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,280
- But I can't tell you.
- What...? Don't be a tease, Paul. 

213
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,440
What now? Maybe a sprinkling of flour? 

214
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,840
No. 

215
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,040
Cold... 

216
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,560
fridge. 

217
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,480
- But it's too late - you've already cut them anyway, so...
- That's it. 

218
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,200
MEL: Bakers, I don't want to put the wind up you... 

219
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,360
I do. You've got an hour to go. 

220
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,400
You're halfway through your Signature Bake. 

221
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,560
These have to be at least ten inches, 

222
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,960
so that's my ten-inch marker. 

223
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,600
Everyone's measuring theirs. I'm not measuring mine. 

224
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,840
Living on the edge. 

225
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,640
- You've made spaghetti.
- Yeah. And I can just trim it down the edge. 

226
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,240
That's the idea, once its relaxed, 

227
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,040
and hopefully it won't spring in too much. 

228
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,800
- So it's on a sort of chill-plinth? 
- A chill-plinth. I'm not! 

229
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,080
No. If only I was. 

230
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,520
I've seen what everyone else is doing and everyone else's 

231
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,960
look better, so my confidence level is down here now. 

232
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,680
It was up here this morning - now it's down here somewhere. 

233
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,120
- Hello.
- Hello, hello. 

234
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,320
- Frances, you're the only one doing a sweet bread...
- Yes. 

235
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,760
..so tell us about it. 

236
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,720
Well, it's basically a giant matchstick. What am I thinking? 

237
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,800
Breadstick. So I like to play with words, so I thought of matchstick 

238
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,200
and then I thought of heat, so it's sort of being laced with ginger. 

239
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,000
Everything Frances makes has a concept, and today's idea is... 

240
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,560
giant matchsticks dipped in chilli chocolate. 

241
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,480
- Do you want to see the box?
- Yeah. 

242
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,160
How do you DO this? 

243
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,240
I can't even get out of bed of a morning. 

244
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,640
They're all going to be lying in here, and there'll be a few on the side as well. 

245
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,120
You've been busy, young lady. 

246
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you, darling. 

247
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,240
I'm going to just do the salt and then put them in. 

248
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,040
- SHE WHISPERS:
- There we go. 

249
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,160
Oh, look at them in there. They look so sweet. 

250
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,000
All 36 breadsticks should be identical. 

251
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,320
24 more to go. 

252
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,840
10, 12, 14. All present and correct. 

253
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,400
The final hurdle is deciding on the oven temperature. 

254
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,640
You don't want any fluffy breadsticks. 

255
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,440
Get it wrong and the result will be soft or bendy breadsticks. 

256
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,120
I've turned the oven up a bit to try and get them to cook quicker, 

257
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,360
which is probably the wrong thing to do. 

258
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,800
I'm doing a slow bake, to drive all the moisture out. We'll see. 

259
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,480
I'll test the moisture, actually, because normally... 

260
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,680
No. Needs more. 

261
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,640
OK, bakers! Just 15 minutes...till you snap! 

262
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,120
Two, four, six, eight, ten. So there's ten there. 

263
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,000
There's 12 in there, so that's 22. Wow. 

264
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,800
SHE EXHALES HARD 

265
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,240
I don't know whether to turn the oven up. 

266
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,280
Sod it. 

267
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,840
Up. We're going hotter, we're going hotter. 

268
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,320
Needs more time. 

269
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,680
31, 32, 33, 34. Bugger. 

270
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,200
My maths GCSE has failed me. I'm two short. 

271
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,320
God, that smells good. 

272
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,960
How many of these have you cooked this week in preparation? 

273
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,920
About 200. 

274
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,360
HE EXHALES 

275
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,200
They're not done. They're not done. 

276
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,560
They need to obviously set, don't they? Have you got enough time for them to set? 

277
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,120
That's why this is happening. It's just ice cooling it. 

278
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,200
Oh, that's very clever. 

279
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,680
11, 12, 13, 14. 

280
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
Jeez - I can't count. I do have enough. 

281
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,880
Bakers, you've only got a minute to go. 

282
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,760
Arghhh! 

283
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,320
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!
- Oh, well caught! 

284
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,400
Hey, well held, that man. 

285
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,640
Oh, oh, oh - oh, no! Casualty. 

286
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,640
- Have they got to come out? They've got to come out. 
- They've got to come out. 

287
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,920
They look slightly more albino but, you know... 

288
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,640
A little bit bendy, but hey - it's a breadstick. 

289
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,600
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. 

290
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,440
Time's up. 

291
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,560
Your Signature Challenge is over. 

292
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,720
Step away from the ovens. 

293
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,760
OK. Sorry, sorry. 

294
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,600
- Nice snap.
- I like that finish. 

295
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,240
- They're delicious. They are. 
- (That's a really good flavour.) 

296
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,040
The garlic is lovely in there. I also like the Parmesan. 

297
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,920
The curls on that are beautiful, as well. 

298
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,440
- You were worried about doing these as well.
- Very. 

299
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,640
And the cheese, the blue cheese, Roquefort. Just there. Well done. 

300
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,120
- Thank you so much.
- They're lovely. 
- Thank you very much. 

301
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,520
They're so irregular in colour - 

302
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,720
there's not one uniform colour through all of them. 

303
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,120
My third batch, which I think is pretty obvious which one it was... 

304
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,320
I ran out of time. 

305
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,840
It's like a bread. If you drop the temperature a little bit, 

306
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,680
that'll give you more of an even bake 

307
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,280
and dry it out a little bit more. 

308
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,560
- But I think your flavours are excellent.
- I like the Parmesan. 

309
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,200
It's really coming through and there's rosemary there 

310
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,720
and I like that. 

311
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,200
By the sound of you next to me, they're crisp. 

312
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,920
Nice, good bake. 

313
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,160
I like the fennel. There's not too much. 

314
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,600
It's a lovely combination. 

315
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,920
Thank you. 

316
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,200
- So...
- Oh, God. 

317
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,240
Perfect. 

318
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,720
SHE LAUGHS 

319
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,040
Oh! 

320
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,680
The flavours in there... Wow. 

321
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,280
I think they're very nice. 

322
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,480
I like the look of them - they're very neat, very precise, very you. 

323
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,600
Oh, good. 

324
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,360
That's not chewy, it does break and it crumbles in your mouth. 

325
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,640
Which is fantastic. 

326
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,520
Good for playing Spillikins with, as well. 

327
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,720
Yes, I remember that. 

328
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,840
Yes, do you remember that game? Come on, Bez... 

329
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,000
- Then you take one without moving any...
- You're breaking them! Move away! 

330
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,320
No, I want to play now. 

331
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,760
Go away. Leave them alone. Well done, mate. Well done. 

332
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,000
OK, cheers. 

333
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,000
Aw, look at those. 

334
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,200
So, what do we give for presentation? 

335
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,040
You've got them beautifully even. 

336
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,240
I could take a little bit more ginger. 

337
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,360
The flavours, I'm not sure should be in a breadstick. 

338
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,200
I think the box is fantastic, though. 

339
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,760
Thank you very much. 

340
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,960
- Oh, did you hear that?
- Oh. 

341
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,320
- Oh, I did. Thank God. 
- I wasn't expecting that. 

342
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,640
Do you know what? I was half expecting for it to bend. 

343
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,360
- Yeah. So was I. 
- That's a great snap. 

344
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,640
They're snapping lovely. They look so pretty. 

345
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,400
- To get those different colours in there with the bands...
- Yeah. 

346
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,440
..is very clever. I was concerned about them 

347
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,840
splitting apart, but that's not the case. 

348
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,800
The bake is perfect, the flavour's got a great kick to it. 

349
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,280
- The chilli's coming through.
- It's hot!
- It's good though, isn't it? 

350
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,360
- Nice.
- I think you've got the flavours right, but I think 

351
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,080
the dough needed a bit more attention - 

352
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,880
a bit more care when you're rolling out. 

353
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,000
They went into the oven much more even than they came out. 

354
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,320
- Welcome to yeast! 
- SHE CHUCKLES 

355
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,800
- There's a snap. 
- There is a snap? 

356
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,080
I like the rosemary very much. I don't go on the raisin... 

357
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,160
I really like them. 

358
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,400
I think the raisin does bring something to the party. 

359
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,640
It brings that moisture to it. Overall, I'm impressed, yeah. 

360
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,640
They needed longer in the oven. 

361
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,560
That's why they're chewy, rather than... 

362
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,280
- That one especially. 
- Yeah, yeah. 

363
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,080
What interesting flavours. That lemon is coming through. 

364
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,120
You are very powerful with your flavours, 

365
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,520
- but I think, on this, the baking's caught you out.
- Yeah. 

366
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,440
They're very plain. 

367
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,480
It's irregular, when you look at that. 

368
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,320
What you've technically got there is a baseball bat. 

369
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,080
Erm... Again, that comes down to the roll and the cutting itself. 

370
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,760
If you'd done twists on it and left it with a little bit of salt 

371
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,840
at the end or sesame or Parmesan 

372
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,680
or something to give it a bit of a kick. 

373
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,280
- They're just a little bit boring. 
- OK. 

374
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,000
They're all a bit strange shapes, aren't they? What happened? 

375
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,720
- They just went a little bit bendy. 
- Are they meant to be like that? 

376
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,840
Whenever I've made them in the week, they've always come out like that. 

377
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,920
- Good snap.
- Nice.
- Good. 

378
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,000
That little bit of flavour coming from that fennel is delicious. 

379
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,120
- Good. 
- And not too much heat, just right. 

380
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,200
- And there isn't too much heat, no. 
- No. 

381
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,480
- Thank you.
- Thank you. 

382
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,920
Paul picked up that they all bent a little bit 

383
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,480
which I quite like, actually, 

384
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,480
because they look more home-made than opened a packet. 

385
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,080
I'm so relieved they're OK. I feel almost euphoric. 

386
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,400
The crack was there, the bake was even, the flavours were good. 

387
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,480
I'm... I'm thumbs up. Happy. 

388
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,800
I was pleased with the structure of them, had a good snap, but I chose 

389
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:56,400
to go for something more simple, so that's the way the breadstick snaps. 

390
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,080
One bake down. The 12 bakers now head into uncharted territory. 

391
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,360
Bakers. Welcome back. It's time for your bread Technical Challenge. 

392
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,640
Now, Paul and Mary, we really don't want you to be around to see whose 

393
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,000
bake is whose, so if you wouldn't mind please leaving the tent. 

394
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,240
- Thank you.
- Better be good. 

395
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:38,120
Today, we're asking you to make eight identical English muffins. 

396
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,880
Now, what we're looking for is an even bake, a chewy texture 

397
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,120
and light air holes in the actual crumb texture. 

398
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,040
And I should say there was a bit of a glint in Paul's eye as he left - 

399
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,480
it's one of his recipes. 

400
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,880
So, no biggie. 

401
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,200
You've got two and three quarter hours to make English muffins. 

402
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,080
- On your marks.
- Get set.
- Bake! 

403
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,360
With only basic instructions, the Technical Challenge is 

404
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,560
a test of their baking instincts. 

405
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,240
Is there anything they've given us? 

406
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,800
Add the yeast, salt, sugar, butter, egg, milk and mix together. 

407
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,080
The distinct texture 

408
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,440
and the flavour of a muffin comes from making an enriched dough. 

409
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,080
The only thing that's going to help me on this is the fact that 

410
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,160
I know what the end result should be like. 

411
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,920
This is a journey into the unknown. 

412
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,240
I have made them before, but they were a complete disaster. 

413
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,480
My husband still ate them though. Bless him. 

414
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,960
Well, there they are, Mary - muffins. 

415
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,080
Oh, do you know, I love the feel as I touch that. 

416
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,400
It's sort of squidgy at the sides. 

417
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,160
The ones that get it right will have that beautifully brown top, 

418
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,440
a brown bottom. 

419
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,400
It'll be white around the edges. 

420
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,840
The texture's soft, it's got a good crumb structure on there. 

421
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,440
It's baked all the way through. 

422
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,560
Let's see who's going to use their nous 

423
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,440
and make some perfectly formed English muffins. 

424
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,120
The high liquid content of enriched dough makes it very difficult to knead. 

425
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,520
I have no idea what I'm doing, because this looks disgusting. 

426
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,880
It's really sticky and actually it's quite nice working with. 

427
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,320
I love kneading. 

428
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,720
I should go to the gym more often. 

429
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,160
I can see it's building up. 

430
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,000
- Is it?
- The gluten.
- What can you see? 

431
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,440
It's got a bit of stretch. 

432
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,760
It's like a sixth sense. 

433
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,720
Instead of dead people, you see gluten all the time. 

434
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,280
This dough is very wet and I know to keep adding more flour 

435
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,160
would be a mistake. So, you've just got to keep working it 

436
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,360
until it becomes smooth and doesn't stick any more. 

437
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,720
It's getting there. 

438
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,680
Baking has been a hobby of Christine's for 60 years, 

439
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,200
but since retiring it's become an obsession. 

440
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,920
This is the hard bit, I think. 

441
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,800
It's the bit you've got to get right. 

442
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,600
That's much better. That's more like it. 

443
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,320
Place the dough in a bowl and prove. Prove. 

444
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,040
Doesn't say how long, nothing. But when in doubt - 

445
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,160
one hour. 

446
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,360
The butter and sugar in enriched dough 

447
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,400
slows down the formation of gluten producing a softer structure. 

448
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,160
Knowing when it's proved enough can be tricky. 

449
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,360
You can see the air holes in it, so the yeast is happy. 

450
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,720
I'm going to take that out. It's springing back when I touch it. 

451
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,960
Yeah, I just think it looks right. 

452
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,800
It would have been nice if it had puffed up a little more, 

453
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,240
but I can work with it. 

454
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,120
To maintain the muffins' characteristic air holes, 

455
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,480
the dough should be handled with care. 

456
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,280
Very gently. Love the dough. 

457
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,040
It says roll it out, 

458
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,200
but I really don't want to take a rolling pin to this. 

459
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,640
A builder by trade, when Mark's not decorating houses, 

460
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,840
he's decorating cakes. 

461
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,480
The only muffin I've had before, 

462
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,000
it's from a popular fast food burger restaurant. 

463
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,000
So, they're about this size. 

464
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,520
The instructions don't stipulate what size the muffins should be. 

465
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,160
Probably like... How large are muffins? 

466
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,280
I probably would too. 

467
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,280
I'm thinking this size, based purely on the fact that I think it's 

468
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,120
an appealing size for a muffin. 

469
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,000
Trying to think what size they are when you buy them. 

470
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,760
So, I'm probably that one really, if I'm honest. 

471
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,720
I'm still undecided! 

472
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,120
Deborah is an experienced baker who likes to give every recipe 

473
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,040
her own twist. 

474
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,600
What you might do, if you get it wrong, is to have one massive 

475
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,480
muffin and seven small ones. 

476
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,480
They might be also be too thick, because you choose the wrong one. 

477
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,280
The difficulty is going be not having them raw, isn't it? 

478
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,160
That would be good - not to have them raw, because I tell you what... 

479
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,880
Let me think - would Paul Hollywood like it raw? 

480
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,680
Having committed to the size of cutter... 

481
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,200
That's barely even round. 

482
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,160
...they'll need to get eight muffins from the dough. 

483
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,040
I think I've made it a bit too thin, because I can get nine out of this. 

484
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,560
There's going to be a bit left over. 

485
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,680
So maybe this should have been bigger. 

486
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,440
The muffins are then coated in semolina 

487
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,320
and proved for a second time. 

488
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,000
Now, we play the waiting game. 

489
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,280
Do you know the muffin man? 

490
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,720
- The muffin man?
- Muffin man. 

491
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,960
Do you know the muffin man? 

492
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,720
He lives on Drury Lane. 

493
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,840
No. 

494
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,680
Right, well, if you'd lived in the Industrial Revolution, 

495
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,520
you'd know of course who the muffin man was, because you'd encounter him on a regular basis. 

496
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,440
- You've made a mess of that.
- Sounds creepy. What, loads of muffin men? 

497
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,160
Much easier if you work with me. 

498
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,440
In the 19th century, the muffin man was just one of an army of sellers 

499
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,440
who hawked food in the UK's busiest towns and cities. 

500
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,440
The muffin had humble beginnings, developed by the working classes 

501
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,400
to use up left-over bits of dough and yeast. 

502
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,240
They were shaped and baked on a hot griddle. 

503
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,000
We believe that servants were baking them 

504
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,720
in the kitchens below stairs, some of the masters got to try this tasty 

505
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,600
snack and liked it so much that they started to ask for it to be 

506
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,160
served at tea time and it became quite popular. 

507
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,080
The trend spread. 

508
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,040
During the Industrial Revolution, the muffin's popularity grew as 

509
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,520
urban areas became increasingly crowded 

510
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,520
with rural workers seeking employment. 

511
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,680
Often, their accommodation wasn't great, so they didn't necessarily 

512
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,680
have the cooking facilities or equipment, so street sellers 

513
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,680
were in a great position to feed the labouring population and muffins 

514
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,560
at a ha'penny each were perfect for people to buy as a filling snack. 

515
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,560
Competing against other street traders, 

516
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,200
the muffin man had a unique way of drumming up business. 

517
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,640
The muffin man carried a bell 

518
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,160
and he would call people from their houses to come and buy his muffins. 

519
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,000
If you're thinking about the noisy streets of the 19th century, 

520
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,040
many other sellers of food, 

521
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,040
you have to make yourself stand out and get noticed. 

522
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,360
Muffin men often became local popular characters. 

523
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,040
An example of this would be John of Cheltenham. 

524
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,400
He stood only three foot tall and apparently he became 

525
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,120
so famous that he sold portraits of himself alongside his muffins. 

526
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,480
But in 1829, the newly-introduced police made trading 

527
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,160
increasingly difficult, eventually banning the muffin man's bell, 

528
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,520
so this iconic figure gradually faded from our streets. 

529
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,720
Oh, they're just not rising enough. 

530
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,800
I'm looking round to see if anyone's got thicker ones than I have. 

531
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,640
- Mega muffins.
- Mega muffins. 
- Mega muffin! 

532
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,880
Two of mine aren't as big, but I just need to let that go 

533
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,600
and just try and make sure that they're all evenly baked. 

534
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,440
Muffins are baked on a griddle or hot plate. 

535
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,160
I don't even know what a hot plate is. 

536
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,800
- A griddle is...
- A griddle is a hot plate.
- Oh, look, there you go. 

537
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,240
Oh, yeah, you've got one, but to me baking stuff goes in the oven. 

538
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,000
In Roman times, they'd have done it on an open fire, yeah? 

539
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,120
- But did they make English muffins in Roman times? 
- Well, they made Roman... 

540
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,680
They made blooming Roman muffins! 

541
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,080
OK, bakers. Your muffins, my mush, 30 minutes! 

542
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,080
Judging the temperature of the hot plate is vital. 

543
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,080
I've been putting my face over it to test the heat coming off. 

544
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,360
It does feel warm, yeah. 

545
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,240
It's a bit of an unknown quantity, this bit. 

546
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,920
A high heat might bake the outside too quickly... 

547
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,840
Oh, that one's sizzling a bit. I don't know what happened there. 

548
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,760
..leaving the middle raw. 

549
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,000
I'm going to keep on looking at their bottoms 

550
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,600
to make sure they're not catching. 

551
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,000
But a lower temperature could dry out the muffin. 

552
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,040
How the heck do you know that they're done inside? 

553
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,400
Is it just guessing? 

554
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,840
- No.
- Science? 

555
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,080
I put a little bit on the stove at the same time. 

556
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,560
It's much smaller, but it was cooked all the way through. 

557
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,600
- But the same thickness. 
- Same thickness.
- Very clever. 

558
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,440
(I don't think anyone else has done that.) 

559
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,040
# Ain't nobody love you like I love you. # 

560
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,720
We're just all looking round going... 

561
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,000
"Has anyone else got more to finish?" Size, colour. It's crazy. 

562
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,280
They're muffins. 

563
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,720
No, it's good, it's good. Just be patient. 

564
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,120
It's not quite an even bake, is it? 

565
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,880
Because that one there is still showing a bit of the yellow. 

566
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,080
It's hard to say. Oh, right. 

567
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,040
- And these ones just muffins-in-waiting?
- Yes, they are. 

568
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,600
Now, I hate to be the bearer of bad news... 

569
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,160
Oh, no! 

570
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,360
Has it been leaned on? When did that happen? 

571
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,600
Howard, I need to break something to you... 

572
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,000
I think that's my elbow. 

573
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,920
I think that's my elbow on your muffin. 

574
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,160
I think I've elbowed your... 

575
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,720
How can I make this right? 

576
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,000
Right, I'm going to have to elbow everyone's muffins 

577
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,520
and make it an even playing field. 

578
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,760
I'm going to put a knee in some, head-butt a few others 

579
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,000
and then it's all good. 

580
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,120
Bakers, you've got five minutes left on your muffins. 

581
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,920
I'm in danger of overcooking them 

582
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,360
but I really don't want them to be doughy in the middle. 

583
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,880
Not sure if they're done or not. 

584
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,440
They actually look better than I thought they were going to 

585
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,360
but that one still isn't cooked on the outside. 

586
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,160
Oh, how do you know? How do you know? 

587
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,720
- Are you confident?
- As long as I'm not last, I'm happy. 

588
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,920
- Is that confidence? 
- That's all right, that's OK. 

589
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,560
Going to give that one fraction more. 

590
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,720
That's it, best I can do. 

591
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,200
Oh, I feel quite moved by them. 

592
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,920
I hope it doesn't rip them apart. 

593
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,720
That's it, time's up. 

594
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,680
OK, bakers, you know the drill - 

595
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,040
if you'd like to bring your hot muffins up to the altar 

596
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,640
and pop them behind the photo of yourself. 

597
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,280
Mary and Paul are looking for eight identical English muffins. 

598
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,520
A rich colour on both sides and a chewy texture. 

599
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,400
If you have a look at these... 

600
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,280
The size, I think, for me, is a little bit too small. 

601
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,840
I'd like to see them a little bit bigger. 

602
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,600
It's quite doughy inside. 

603
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,840
Especially with your big thumb pushing it down - 

604
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,360
you can make it really doughy. 

605
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,280
The hot plate was just a little bit too hot. 

606
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,480
I'm not going to eat this one 

607
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,760
because its raw dough and I'll have a stomach ache. 

608
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,400
I don't fancy that, thank you very much. OK, so we'll move on. 

609
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,040
We've got some irregular sizes here 

610
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,320
and that's to do with the resting of the dough itself. 

611
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,480
It tastes OK. 

612
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,120
Moving on to the next one. 

613
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,800
It's not bad, it's got a strong colour, 

614
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,240
it's just a little bit too thin for me but it tastes good. 

615
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,840
Yeah, this one's baked. 

616
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,440
- I think it has to be because it's so thin.
- They taste lovely.
- Mm. 

617
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,240
Tastes good. 

618
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,400
Would be better with a little less heat underneath though. 

619
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,560
Now, we've got an issue with size difference. 

620
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,640
Some of them are very overcooked, over-browned. 

621
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,440
But moving on to the next one... 

622
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,480
It needs to be much bigger, nearly double the height. 

623
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,840
It's just, just done. 

624
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,440
Next one. It's a bigger size, it's a good-size cutter. 

625
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,680
It's a good colour, though, it's not too dark. 

626
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,280
Yeah, it is a nice colour. 

627
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,440
It tastes good. 

628
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,680
That had an injury... Uh, blunt force trauma, but... 

629
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,520
- Was this one of you two? 
- It involved my elbow. 

630
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,840
Unfortunately, this is slightly raw. 

631
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,120
You see what I mean? It just leaves that dough mark in the middle of it. 

632
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,680
That's a pity. 

633
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,680
These look quite consistent - good size, good colour. 

634
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,600
Good temperature on the hot plate there and it tastes good. 

635
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,240
Let's have a look at these. 

636
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,240
Bit of irregularity - some of them are thin, some are thick. 

637
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,120
I'm getting parts of it that are under-baked 

638
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,400
and parts that are baked. 

639
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,480
Finally, the last one - these look OK. 

640
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,760
- Nice taste. 
- I think they're a very good batch. 

641
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,320
After the final taste, Paul and Mary will now mark the bakers. 

642
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,960
- So in 12th place is this one. Who's that?
- Mine. 

643
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,760
It was a little doughy in the middle, not quite done. 

644
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,640
In 11th place is...this one. 

645
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,640
It's down to the irregular sizes. 

646
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,800
- Very, very different. 
- I know, I know. 

647
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,480
In tenth place is Howard, followed by Ali in ninth, 

648
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,360
Deborah is eighth... 

649
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,840
Glenn finishes seventh and Mark is sixth. 

650
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,600
In fifth place is Rob. 

651
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,520
And in fourth place, a good batch 

652
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,960
but again, a little uneven in size... 

653
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,520
And third is Ruby. 

654
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,800
In second place, these were a lovely regular size. 

655
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,320
(Thank you.) 

656
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,320
So, number one is this one. 

657
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,520
Well done. 

658
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,720
APPLAUSE 

659
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,760
Good, regular size... 

660
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,440
all nice and even. 

661
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,560
Nice light brown colour as well, actually, 

662
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,240
and the inside of that was very, very good. Well done. 

663
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,640
I'm feeling really pleased. 

664
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,440
It feels really good to have such a good result on something 

665
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,600
that was brand new to me. 

666
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,120
I feel like it puts me in a nice position for tomorrow. 

667
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,600
Ah, rubbish. 

668
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,640
And I'm just annoyed with myself and I feel like... It's just annoying. 

669
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,400
SHE SOBS 

670
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,840
I think Paul thinks, after today, 

671
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,480
that I'm probably not a very good baker. 

672
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,760
So I need to pull that back, I need to regain some reputation. 

673
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,000
I know I'm good and it's just annoying 

674
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,400
that when I do a stupid mistake like that, 

675
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,240
it could potentially get me out of the competition 

676
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,960
and I'm so NOT ready to go. Oh. 

677
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,240
SHEEP BAAS 

678
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,440
Just the Showstopper Challenge remains. 

679
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,280
Who's looking good so far? 

680
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,040
For me, there's two people that have stepped away - Kimberley and Ruby. 

681
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,120
They both had a beautiful finish and flavour in their breadsticks 

682
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,640
and then first and third, respectively, in the technical. 

683
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,960
So I think both of them are looking pretty strong. 

684
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,560
What we saw in that challenge was the breadsticks - 

685
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,040
that you think of as just very simple, very plain. 

686
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,080
- And we had that from Lucy. 
- She didn't have a good day. 

687
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,000
And then she was last on the Technical 

688
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,720
so that automatically puts her in a very precarious position 

689
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,240
going into the Showstopper. 

690
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,880
Beca did some bendy breadsticks. 

691
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,920
And also, she didn't do so well with her muffins. 

692
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,720
Howard did so brilliantly last week - slightly fallen away. 

693
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,520
His flavours are unbelievable but tenth on technical. 

694
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,200
It really puts the pressure on. 

695
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,000
Every single baker in the tent goes into the Showstopper 

696
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,920
needing it to be really, really good. 

697
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,840
- Was that a pun?
- Oh, was that a pun? 
- No, it actually wasn't. 

698
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,360
It felt a bit awkward. I didn't know if you needed supportive laughter. 

699
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,240
- Let's just leave a silence, shall we?
- Yeah. 

700
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,760
Morning, bakers, great to see you all here 

701
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,960
on Showstopper Challenge day. 

702
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,080
Now, we would really like you, please, 

703
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:24,160
to create a beautifully, decoratively shaped loaf. 

704
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,320
It can be any shape that you choose. 

705
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,680
It could be a plaited Jewish challah bread, 

706
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,480
it could be in the shape of an ear of corn, your favourite pet, 

707
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,920
or the Leatherhead Leisure Centre. 

708
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,960
And the flavours, flowers, the froufrou is all up to you. 

709
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,920
Of course, we want something extraordinary, 

710
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,400
we want something memorable. 

711
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,320
Paul and Mary have asked for perfect fermentation, 

712
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,760
perfect dough, perfect crust perfect crumb structure - 

713
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,800
how perfectly irritating of you both. 

714
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,720
So you've got four hours to bake this. 

715
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,760
- On your marks. 
- Get set.
- And bake. 

716
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,800
To produce the perfect show-stopping decorative loaf, 

717
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,960
the bakers will need to know how dough reacts 

718
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,440
when twisted, shaped and moulded. 

719
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,080
We're looking for innovative flavours, 

720
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,920
we're looking for fantastic shapes that I've never seen before, 

721
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,360
which is going to be difficult. 

722
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,040
I know some of them will be very ambitious. 

723
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,160
We're hoping that the personality will come through 

724
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,440
of the bakers with what they've chosen. 

725
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,320
The key to a good decorative loaf is the dough. 

726
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,640
I'm using flour from a local mill. 

727
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,880
It's just a small place 

728
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,640
and they usually make it from all-local wheat. 

729
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,960
It's good luck. 

730
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,480
Their base recipe will affect the bake, as well as the flavour. 

731
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,920
I've just scalded my milk 

732
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,760
because I heard somewhere that there's something in milk 

733
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,760
that might make the structure for bread a little bit tighter 

734
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,600
but if you boil it, or just scald it, 

735
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,640
then that changes the structure of the milk, 

736
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,640
so it helps the bread stay light. 

737
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,680
Ruby is the only baker making a sweet bread. 

738
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,760
She's kneading white chocolate and orange zest 

739
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,680
into her enriched dough and shaping it into a peacock. 

740
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,200
- Wowsers.
- I say, that's quite... 

741
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,080
- We've never had a peacock, have we? 
- No. 

742
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,000
Did you do any mixing in a mixer or have you done it all by hand? 

743
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,520
- By hand.
- Why have you done it by hand rather than in a mixer? 

744
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,160
Because I don't have a mixer at home 

745
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,240
and I'm not going to start using one at this crucial moment, so... 

746
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,120
Kimberley is also using enriched dough. 

747
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,880
It's really lovely dough to work with. 

748
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,000
Hopefully it'll have a very, very soft crumb, 

749
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,080
which is why I used it for this recipe. 

750
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,760
She's making a tear-and-share loaf by layering individual slices 

751
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,720
of her rolled dough into a intricate circular pattern. 

752
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,840
I call it my peace bread because it combines 

753
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,120
traditional Jewish and Arabic food. 

754
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,560
So it's a saffron-flavoured base, 

755
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,240
which I'm filling with a mixture 

756
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,600
of onions, garlic and za'atar spice blend 

757
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,360
and then I'm decorating that with Iranian rose petals. 

758
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,160
Mary and Paul are expecting a wide variety of flavours. 

759
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,680
Oregano. 

760
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,400
Smells amazing. 

761
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,320
Adding the ingredients at the kneading stage 

762
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,680
gives the flavours a chance to develop while the dough proves. 

763
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,720
What I'm wanting to do is concentrate 

764
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,800
on getting a nice smooth dough with an even texture, 

765
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,520
putting some of the flavours in 

766
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,800
and then using that to shape the finished object. 

767
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,400
Inspired by a Picasso print he has at home, 

768
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,960
Howard's decorative loaf will be shaped like the sun. 

769
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,800
I'm trying to do something which is a bit Mediterranean in flavour. 

770
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,120
I've added some orange zest to it and some fresh oregano. 

771
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,000
I think you've got to be careful 

772
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,800
when you're adding a lot of flavour, that it doesn't overwhelm... 

773
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,400
Orange with oregano? 

774
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,200
I'll be interested to see how that sharpness comes through 

775
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,000
- with all that herb, but good luck. 
- OK, thank you. 

776
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,960
I'm roasting my tomatoes at the moment. 

777
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,480
I'm going to just squeeze them 

778
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,480
and then use that as the liquid in my bread. 

779
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,800
To give added flavour to her roasted tomato and garlic bread, 

780
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,200
Lucy is using her home-grown yeast. 

781
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,400
That is my sour dough starter. 

782
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,280
I made that with an apple from my garden. 

783
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,360
So I've just added a little bit of that 

784
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,320
to add a bit of depth of flavour to my bread. 

785
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,720
It's a nice idea, but what shape are you doing them? 

786
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,960
It's just quite a simple shape. Broadly like a tomato. 

787
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,880
Round, cutting on the top and then with the tomatoes on the top. 

788
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,720
- So you've got four hours to do that in?
- Yes. 

789
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,800
And so you could have done just a little bit more 

790
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,680
in the way of shaping or something. 

791
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,160
Well, I could have done... 

792
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,600
but I think it looks quite glamorous. 

793
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,160
- Obviously, you'll give me your opinions on it, so...
- OK. 

794
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,960
Good luck. 

795
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,800
- Yeah, good luck, Lucy. See you later.
- Thank you. 

796
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,520
- SUE:
- So it can hold its shape, the dough will need to prove 

797
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,520
so the gluten can strengthen... 

798
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,920
..giving one baker time to contemplate the work ahead. 

799
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,400
There's a red card, a couple of flags, various types. 

800
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,040
I've got a knife that I need to cut the gills. 

801
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,840
Tape measure because the tentacles have to be all the same length. 

802
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,560
There's a football and a siphon. 

803
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,040
Otherwise, I've got nowhere to paint the whistle. 

804
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,720
Rob's decorative bread 

805
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,440
is in honour of an eight-tentacled football legend. 

806
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,560
- It's a Paul the Psychic Octopus tribute loaf.
- Of course it is. 

807
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,760
This was the octopus that they thought predicted 

808
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,320
- the scores during the World Cup? 
- That's right, yes. 

809
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,880
The octopus, is it having its legs joined on 

810
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,880
while it's baking, or are they being baked separately? 

811
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,480
No, it's all going in as one. 

812
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,080
So you're limited in size according to the oven? 

813
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,680
- I shall fill it. 
- Will it be able to predict? 

814
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,400
It's holding a red card, I hope it's not predicting anything for me. 

815
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,800
I'm really happy with that prove and just now... 

816
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,400
I've given myself half an hour now to weigh it and plait it. 

817
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,080
- SUE:
- Once proved, the dough can begin to take shape. 

818
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,320
I've created 16 segments. 

819
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:09,680
These will rise and expand and look like petals. 

820
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,520
Well, the plaits are the peacock's feathers. 

821
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,040
I'm just trying to fit them all on. 

822
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,360
I just wanted something ridiculous and over the top 

823
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,480
and that fits the bill. 

824
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,000
So you're making a tomato bread in the shape of a tomato? 

825
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,640
Broadly, it's going to be a tomato with a slight twist. 

826
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,680
What's the twist? It looks like a banana. 

827
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,840
- It's got some more tomatoes on the top.
- OK. 

828
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,400
You could make it into the Brighton Pavilion, 

829
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,920
or you could make it into...the gherkin, 

830
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,160
or you could do any number of fantastical things with it. 

831
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,000
But you're determined to keep it simple. 

832
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,360
Yeah, I am determined to keep it simple. 

833
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,960
I've got to get the eyes in. 

834
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,400
This is the head, I forgot to roll them in the excitement. 

835
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,360
I've made it loads of times - 

836
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,960
it never really comes out exactly how I'd like it. 

837
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,120
I need to make sure that the dough is within the lines 

838
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,520
after it's relaxed rather than before it's relaxed. 

839
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,400
See, I'm learning about bread. 

840
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,840
Ali's Showstopper is based 

841
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,200
on the ancient Chinese concept of yin and yang. 

842
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,960
White chocolate and apricot flavour on one side 

843
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,280
and chicken tikka and paneer on the other. 

844
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,840
Where did you get the inspiration for this? 

845
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,360
It sounds weird but it actually came in a dream. 

846
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,840
I was dreaming and there was bread in my head 

847
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,360
and it had a yin-yang symbol 

848
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,480
and I woke up, I was like, "Yin and yang bread." 

849
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,480
It's original, and that's what we're after. 

850
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,440
Yeah, I had a dream that it went quite well...as well. 

851
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,240
Christine, Beca and Mark 

852
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,960
are all incorporating traditional plaits into their design. 

853
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,400
I find creating really fun. 

854
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,800
Christine's onion, cheese and bacon loaf 

855
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,320
is made up of two three-strand plaits. 

856
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,400
You know, the making of the dough is great 

857
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,240
but this is the bit that is the exciting bit. 

858
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,400
Mark is attempting a Paul Hollywood special. 

859
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,720
- OK, shall I read and you do? 
- Eight...
- And a seven. 

860
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,600
The eight-strand plait. 

861
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,080
If I was into subterfuge, I could really mess you up right now. 

862
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,360
11 over 16... 

863
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,880
and that's really the end of my attention span. 

864
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,240
Oh, look, a thing. 

865
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,840
- Watch you don't stretch the legs. 
- No, I don't know... 

866
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,760
Beca is turning her five-strand cinnamon and honey plait 

867
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,760
into a Christmas wreath. 

868
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,200
I haven't looked around to see how anybody else is doing their dough 

869
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,240
because I don't want to be influenced 

870
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,560
or swayed from how I bake at home. 

871
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,120
I'm just not thinking, I'm just getting through it. 

872
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,760
- One, two, right. 
- God, that was like Casualty. 

873
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,240
Bring him in. 

874
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,000
So the loaves can rise again into their new shape, 

875
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,560
they go back into the proving drawer. 

876
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,320
Providing, of course, that they fit. 

877
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,720
The tentacles are much too long to go in the drawer. 

878
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,760
To heat it I'm blowing hot air underneath. 

879
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,280
If I can get this surface at 22, 23, it'll liven up the dough. 

880
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,960
- Infrared thermometer? 
- Yes, they're great things. 

881
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,160
If you do chocolate work, they're the best. 

882
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,560
- Shall I check your thermometer? 
- No, it's got a laser in it. 

883
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,800
Oh, it's got a laser. OK. 

884
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,760
OK, bakers, that's one hour left, one hour left to cook your peacock, 

885
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,240
adjust the exact balance of yin and yang 

886
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,080
and to get the octopus's blowhole right. One hour. 

887
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,960
Before baking, the last intricate details are added. 

888
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,000
I'm behind a man who's making the most infernally complicated 

889
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,920
loaf of bread I've ever seen in my life, 

890
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,800
and I'm baking ears of corn. 

891
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,080
Assuming I get through this week, which is a big assumption 

892
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,360
at this point, I really have to do something spectacular next week. 

893
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,920
I have to say, it's actually looking quite demure for a peacock. 

894
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,800
It's definitely not understated, though, is it? 

895
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,160
No, it's very much in the room. 

896
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,320
There's a presence to it, do you know what I mean? 

897
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,880
I can't believe I'm faffing around with feet. 

898
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,480
I'm just cutting the top of it, 

899
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,760
because that dictates where the steam will come out. 

900
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,800
If you don't cut it, it will just find its own way out, 

901
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,920
and so you can control the shape in that way. 

902
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,280
Right, oven. 

903
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,200
Go. Spring. 

904
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,960
That's better. 

905
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,880
That is the sexiest gluten psychic cephalopod I've ever seen. 

906
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,560
Hopefully it will come out a little bit sexier. 

907
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,880
Rise, cephalopod! 

908
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,720
As soon as the bread enters the oven, 

909
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:42,280
it faces a final burst of rising before the crust hardens. 

910
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,000
I said this is what I wouldn't do. 

911
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,120
I said I wouldn't be one of those lunatics 

912
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,600
kneeling on the floor by the oven. 

913
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,360
And here I am. 

914
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,840
If the bread rises too quickly it can split, 

915
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,600
ruining the intricate designs. 

916
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,840
I don't know why that has dropped. 

917
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,880
It's like the whole thing has just sunk. 

918
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,440
Aaargh! 

919
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,200
Two more minutes. 

920
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,720
I've sort of forgotten which side is the savoury 

921
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,000
and which side is the sweet. 

922
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,840
I thought because they were different colours, it would show, 

923
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,480
but they turned the same colour. 

924
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,880
OK, bakers. Ten minutes left. 

925
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,360
Just ten minutes, thank you. 

926
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,080
It's a little bit stuck... 

927
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,520
Oh, why's that stuck? 

928
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,840
That's sweet, because it smells like it. 

929
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,920
Oh, no. 

930
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,480
Do you want me to hold something? 

931
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,640
No, I'm fine, thank you. 

932
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,600
Hollywood at 12 o'clock. 

933
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,240
Oh, dear! 

934
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,760
Pretty pleased with that. 

935
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,640
Oh, that's hollow-sounding, isn't it? 

936
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,520
It so looked like ears of corn when it went in. 

937
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,720
I might just give it an extra few minutes, on reflection. 

938
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,600
It's fine... don't give me a round of applause. 

939
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,000
It bloody stuck to the tray! 

940
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,240
Bakers, that's time. Please step away from your bakes. 

941
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,760
Rob, stop touching up that octopus! 

942
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,160
All of the decorative loaves now need to be judged 

943
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:12,000
before Mary and Paul decide who is leaving The Great British Bake Off. 

944
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,400
Kimberley. 

945
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,520
I left my bread in just a little bit over. 

946
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,200
I was worried it would be underbaked, 

947
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,280
so it's a bit darker than I would have liked it. 

948
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,680
Otherwise, I'm really pleased. 

949
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,160
Hopefully Paul and Mary will think that I've tried to do 

950
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,160
something a little bit different. 

951
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,840
It covers all the bases. 

952
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,960
We were looking for a highly decorative, creative loaf. 

953
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,000
It's got a lovely structure on it. The crumb is fantastic. 

954
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,760
It's very aromatic. 

955
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,160
That is delicious. 

956
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,360
Absolutely delicious. 

957
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:57,440
I'm really hoping that Paul and Mary forgive my muffin mayhem 

958
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,640
of yesterday and that they will fall in love with my wreath. 

959
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,000
- It's quite raw inside.
- Is it? 

960
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,200
Hmm. You could have tightened up the plait to give it more body 

961
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,560
and it would have gone up and given it more structure 

962
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,600
and it would have opened up in the oven more. 

963
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,400
I was worried when I was plaiting it that I would be overworking it. 

964
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,240
Maybe I was a bit too gentle, a bit too careful. 

965
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,680
The flavour is absolutely lovely, but it is underdone, isn't it? 

966
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,680
Oregano and orange, I would never 

967
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,600
have put together in a million years. 

968
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,480
Howard, you're great with your flavours normally. 

969
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,920
And you've done it again. That's really good. 

970
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,800
But more than that, the structure and the bake is fantastic. 

971
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,720
It's lovely. 

972
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,120
Now we can see the two colours.... 

973
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,560
It's full of vanilla, I like the apricots. 

974
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,080
It's certainly original. What you've done is very clever. 

975
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,160
Thank you. 

976
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,520
It's quite difficult when you've got a bread that colour 

977
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,000
to know when it's done. 

978
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,000
It is underbaked. 

979
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,240
It needed about another ten minutes. 

980
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,320
OK. 

981
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,000
It tastes great. Moist dough, but baked. 

982
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,760
I think it's good. I think you pulled it off. 

983
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,880
I think it looks wonderful. 

984
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,880
It has this lovely bacon-y taste. 

985
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,680
- I think you've got a nice loaf. 
- Thank you very much.
- Well done. 

986
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,520
You got a great bake on it. 

987
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,280
That's really good. I'll tell you why - 

988
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,720
to intertwine two different types of dough, 

989
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,760
that's quite tricky to do. I'm impressed, well done. 

990
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,400
OK, they're the eyes. 

991
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,760
- Er...
- That's the football. 
- That's the football. Ah. 

992
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,080
- That's a whistle.
- What's that? 

993
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,720
It's coming out of its blowhole, Mary. 

994
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,400
That's the technical term, blowhole. 

995
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,240
- I like the idea. I think it's lost a bit in translation.
- Yes. 

996
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,960
Straight between the eyes. 

997
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,920
It's quite doughy down at the bottom. 

998
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,400
It's a very, very tight structure. It needed longer proving. 

999
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,640
Probably another 20 minutes, half an hour. 

1000
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,560
To me, it tastes just like a good white loaf, 

1001
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,360
but that's exactly what it is. 

1002
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,600
You've rather gone for the design. 

1003
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,080
Mark. 

1004
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,520
The look of it is not where I wanted it to be. 

1005
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,440
It could have been straighter and more even, 

1006
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,080
and I'm dead sure Paul is going to pick up on that. 

1007
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,600
They look like rather posh little slugs. 

1008
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,120
I'm not the man to show an eight-strand plait to. 

1009
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,880
No, probably not. 

1010
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,840
It needed more colour, really. It needed more life. 

1011
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,440
It's a bit bland. 

1012
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,640
Right. 

1013
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,880
The garlic is there, but the sage is not there. 

1014
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,640
That's a little bit disappointing. 

1015
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,120
OK. 

1016
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,040
Lucy. 

1017
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,800
I'm really happy with it and I'm excited, 

1018
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,880
because it's the kind of bread that I like, 

1019
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,720
and I'm genuinely interested to hear what Paul and Mary have to say. 

1020
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:32,320
- My issue is, and I think you know what I'm going to say...
- Mm-hm. 

1021
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:36,240
Four hours to produce a creative loaf. 

1022
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,600
When I look at that, I see a cob with tomatoes on top. 

1023
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,160
And you look inside, you see how dense it is down at the bottom. 

1024
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,560
It's an indication it was underproved. 

1025
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,920
That's a really good tomato flavour, 

1026
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,960
and the garlic is coming through too. 

1027
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,640
It's exactly what you say it is. 

1028
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,920
It's a tomato and garlic loaf. 

1029
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,240
Thank you. 

1030
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,600
Ruby. 

1031
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,480
I feel good about how it looks, but I'm not 100% sure on the bake. 

1032
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,320
I put it in there for ages, so hopefully it'll be all right. 

1033
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:27,040
It tastes delicious. It doesn't need anything on it. 

1034
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,360
Very clever. You've added white chocolate to this in lumps, 

1035
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,240
and because you mixed it by hand, 

1036
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,880
you've kept the pieces in there, so every now and again 

1037
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,000
you get that beautiful flavour and then bang, 

1038
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,320
you get some white chocolate. 

1039
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,160
That's a good bake. The flavour's good, the texture's excellent. 

1040
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,080
Please don't take that away from me! 

1041
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,880
- She must.
- Don't take it away from me. 

1042
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,640
With all three challenges complete, 

1043
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:58,000
it's now up to Mary and Paul to decide who stays and who goes. 

1044
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,160
Bread week is often nemesis week, 

1045
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,800
so who do you think struggled and slightly disappointed you? 

1046
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,880
Poor Lucy had a really tough time. 

1047
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,800
We were expecting something creative, something different. 

1048
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,480
I thought Rob was a bit disappointing. 

1049
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,640
I didn't really see an octopus, to be honest. 

1050
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,840
What about Mark's slug plait? 

1051
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,240
Mark's was really disappointing. 

1052
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,400
Beca's tasted good, but the bake was poor and, you know, 

1053
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,560
she was 11th on the technical as well. 

1054
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,920
Let's look at the more positive end of the spectrum, 

1055
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,520
- who's really excelled? 
- Kimberley's use of the za'atar 

1056
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,160
was inspired. Great idea. Likewise, Ruby. 

1057
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,440
I thought Ruby's flavours, using white chocolate, 

1058
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,880
she kneaded it by hand without a machine. 

1059
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,920
I've never seen anything like that before. 

1060
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,000
It's happy bread, that. 

1061
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,240
- Yes.
- Do you know who's going to be Star Baker? 

1062
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,040
We've got one that's standing out, as far as I'm concerned. 

1063
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,720
So, obviously, you can send one or two people away. 

1064
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,320
Have you made up your mind as to who will leave this week? 

1065
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,360
- I have.
- I think we have, actually, yeah. Yeah. 

1066
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,040
Well done, bakers. You've battled bread week, 

1067
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,120
and what a week it's been. Brilliant stuff. 

1068
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,080
We've seen a Picasso, a glazed celebratory ring, 

1069
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,800
and my own personal favourite, a psychic cephalopod. 

1070
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,840
But every week, Paul and Mary get to pick the best of the bunch 

1071
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:25,160
and award the accolade of Star Baker. 

1072
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,840
And this week it was a tough choice, 

1073
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,640
cos so many of you were so very good. 

1074
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,640
But we've decided to give it to somebody 

1075
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,720
with a perfectly worked muffin, 

1076
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,240
somebody who gives Mexico a twist 

1077
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,280
and somebody who delivers the best damn peacock I've ever eaten. 

1078
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,880
Well done, Ruby, you're Star Baker. 

1079
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,040
Well done, Ruby. 

1080
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:45,680
APPLAUSE 

1081
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,040
OK, you all know how the Bake Off works. 

1082
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:59,960
Sadly, we can't take everybody with us next time. 

1083
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,080
So I'm afraid this week, 

1084
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,520
we will be saying goodbye 

1085
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,600
to one person. 

1086
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,640
And that person is... 

1087
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,880
..Lucy. 

1088
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,800
- We're very sorry, Lucy. 
- Sorry to see you go, Lucy. 

1089
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,480
- Sad to see you go.
- Come on. Mel-Sue sandwich. In you come. 

1090
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,400
Mel-Sue sandwich. 

1091
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,480
Well done you. 

1092
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,840
Thank you. It's all right. 

1093
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,880
I feel a bit disappointed, but do you know, 

1094
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,040
I'm kind of OK with it. It's been really fun. 

1095
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,720
Poor Lucy, but yay me! 

1096
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:51,680
I need to go home and practise, practise, practise. 

1097
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,480
And for goodness' sake, don't do any more of Paul's recipes! 

1098
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,160
Can't believe I did it! 

1099
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:00,640
I'm so proud of myself to do well on the things that I enjoy the most, 

1100
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,280
it's just like... 

1101
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,120
Yeah, it's like Christmas has come early. 

1102
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,520
This weekend was just a blip, I'm hoping. 

1103
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,120
Next weekend I go back to my normal self. 

1104
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,520
I'm through! 

1105
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,120
'Oh, thank God for that!' 

1106
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,000
Next time... 

1107
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,800
I'm living dangerously here. 

1108
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,560
..we make room for dessert. 

1109
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,000
Oh, dear. 

1110
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,920
With tantalising trifles... 

1111
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,320
Nice that you're making a succession of wizard's hats. 

1112
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,200
- That is a wizard's hat.
- Gandalf. 

1113
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,480
..faultless floating islands... 

1114
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:37,080
They're misshapen icebergs, and the Titanic is heading for them. 

1115
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,280
..and perfect petits fours. 

1116
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,960
We have to make them small. It goes against all my instincts! 

1117
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,800
Only one can be Star Baker. 

1118
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,240
Ohhh, please...! 

1119
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,120
But how many will go home? 

1120
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,720
Oh, no! 

1121
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,560
Nasty, messy chocolate... 

1122
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,280
Oh, no. 

1123
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,960
Can't do this. 

1124
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,240
