1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,720
We're over halfway through the bake off 

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,080
and a good half-stone heavier. 

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,240
So far, we have consumed 13 sandwich cakes, 497,000 breadsticks, 

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,880
11 tartlets, two tray bakes and a large macaroon. 

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,440
I say we, it's just me, but I have an excellent truss maker. Welcome... 

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,040
To the Great British Bake Off! 

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,120
'Last time...' 

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,120
I literally just want to shove the whole spoon in my mouth. 

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,400
'..Frances' dreams of becoming Star Baker...' Oh! 

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,960
'..collapsed!' 

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,560
- 'Christine triumphed...' 
- I am feeling ecstatic! 

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,120
'..Kimberley, Ruby and Howard clung on...' 

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,800
Oh, I just don't want to be in that position again. 

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,400
I'm pleased that they like my bakes more than I seem to. 

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,160
I'd already booked my cab home. 

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,560
'..but it was Rob's biscuits that saw him "exterminated!"' 

17
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,800
I'm going to take a few days off from baking. 

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,880
- I suspect that is fairly normal. 
- 'Now the seven remaining bakers...' 

19
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,240
I'm scared this is a sign. 

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,600
'..must put their signature on tea-time...' 

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,920
Ooh! Slightly scary when you did that, mate. 

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,640
'..unravel Paul's twisted technical...' 

23
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,560
Am I reading this right? Oh, gosh! 

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,880
'..and deliver 168...' 

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,760
I never bake with this sort of concentration or speed ever. 

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,760
- '..show-stopping sweet buns.' 
- There is going to be no panic. 

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,800
Who am I kidding? 

28
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,680
'But whose dough will be sweetest...' 

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,760
It is kind of hypnotic after a while, isn't it? 

30
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,560
'..and whose bake off...' 

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,880
- Mine has gone splat. 
- '..is about to come to a bitter end?' 

32
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,080
- I can't eat this.
- I think it's probably inevitable. 

33
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,240
Due to a new ruling from the BBC, we are 

34
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,000
no longer allowed to make puns about buns. 

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,640
- Welcome to sweet dough week. 
- Thank you. 

36
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,960
There are seven of us left now, 

37
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,640
and all seven of us want to get to the final. 

38
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,240
Although it is a competition, we do help each other out. 

39
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,520
It is a learning and sharing experience at the minute. 

40
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,720
Feel free to throw up at any point. 

41
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,000
I am just putting my family 

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,440
and friends through the mill at the moment. 

43
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,920
Each week I say, "This might be the week I go," 

44
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,720
and then I've been like, "No, actually, I've got through," 

45
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,600
and it has been causing such a lot of stress for them. 

46
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,880
Everyone at school is sort of really proud and chuffed. 

47
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,920
"You're still in! You're still in!" 

48
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,960
And then just the odd person that is, "Really? Still in? Hmm." 

49
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,680
Hello, bakers. Welcome to this, your signature sweet tea loaf. 

50
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,000
You can make any loaf you like. 

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,960
It could be the classic Welsh Bara Brith, apologies for pronunciation, 

52
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,920
or the Barm Brack from Ireland, or - my own favourite - the Croydon cob, 

53
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,320
which also doubles up as a weapon for close hand-to-hand combat. 

54
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,600
Paul and Mary would like you to use yeast. 

55
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,280
Any other ingredients are completely up to you. 

56
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,760
It can be baked in a tin or free-form and you've got three hours 

57
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,760
on your Signature Challenge, so on your marks... 

58
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,800
- Get set...
- Bake! 

59
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,360
A tea loaf is a sweet yeasted bread, traditionally served at tea-time 

60
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,000
and often flavoured with fruits and spices. 

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
All of our bakers have chosen to make theirs with enriched dough. 

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,680
The difficulty with a tea loaf is, because most of the time 

63
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,120
you're going to put sugar in or butter or eggs, 

64
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,360
any one of those things retards the yeast, it just slows it up, 

65
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,040
so they have got to utilise the time perfectly. 

66
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,440
I think three hours is absolutely fine to make a tea loaf. 

67
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,680
If they are sensible, they will do it in one pound tins. 

68
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,960
I want ones that look evenly baked and are absolutely full of flavour. 

69
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,320
I've got my sultanas here, infusing in some Assam tea. 

70
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,680
I won't be doing the apricots 

71
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,840
because they're quite plump-cious anyway. 

72
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,360
Plump-cious, it's a nice word, isn't it? 

73
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,160
Don't know if it exists but it sounds good. 

74
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,680
Christine's recipe for an Oxford nutty tea loaf has been created 

75
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,360
to perfectly complement a cheese made near her home town. 

76
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,720
I am creating it and I come from near Oxford, 

77
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,640
hence it is going to be the Oxford loaf. 

78
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,680
It would be lovely if it took off, wouldn't it? 

79
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,920
This is sort of like a chai latte I have got 

80
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,480
going on in here at the moment. 

81
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,040
Chai is a spiced Indian tea drink flavoured with, like, cinnamon, 

82
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,120
cardamom and ginger. 

83
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,680
When cut, Frances' chai tea loaf will reveal a cinnamon swirl 

84
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,920
and, unsurprisingly, she has also given some thought to presentation. 

85
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,760
Here we go. Here we go. 

86
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,240
The idea is it just sits in there 

87
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,320
and then its little head just sort of pops up. 

88
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,880
So it looks like a massive, mad, cinnamon cappuccino bun. 

89
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,680
Getting a great texture on the bread is key 

90
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,480
and when you start folding dough, in the time that you've got, 

91
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,760
you've got to make sure that the structure is good. 

92
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,840
- Good luck with that one.
- Thank you. 

93
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Frances is not the only baker using chai tea. 

94
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,520
I think I'd call myself a bit of a flavour magpie. 

95
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,520
There are so many flavours and spices 

96
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,400
and food experiences out there that if I go back to a recipe, 

97
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,480
I will always shift it up a little bit. 

98
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,320
Kimberley is making a chai spiced date and ginger tea loaf, 

99
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,320
and adding an extra layer of flavour. 

100
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,800
I'm going to ripple chai spiced butter through it, which is 

101
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,400
a mixture of green cardamom, ginger, black cardamom, cinnamon 

102
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,680
and some palm sugar. When you cut through it, 

103
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,440
you'll see the kind of ripples of the spices through it. 

104
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,080
I've just realised that I've put my mix into the bowl 

105
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,880
of my weighing scale, instead of into a mixing bowl. 

106
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,600
Howard's tea loaf features a controversial ingredient, 

107
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,080
which has never before appeared on the bake off. 

108
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,400
I've just put the ordinary bread flour in here 

109
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,000
and I am now adding some hemp flour, which is from Yorkshire. 

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,080
It is locally-sourced hemp flour. 

111
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,400
Howard's healthy hemp and date loaf is made with yoghurt 

112
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,640
- and will be kneaded with hemp oil. 
- I know nothing about hemp. 

113
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,000
- Is it a grass?
- It is.
- How can we describe hemp to you, Mary? 

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,400
Let's just say this is the legal side of hemp, so there's 

115
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,320
an illegal side and a legal side and it is very, very good for you. 

116
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,720
- You've got loads of omega-3... 
- It has, yeah. 

117
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,920
- The seeds here but the leaf, as Sue said...
- Is naughty cigarettes, Mary. 

118
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,480
- And the flour is the ground-up inside of the seed?
- It is, yeah. 

119
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,520
The oil is extracted. 

120
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,440
I am using some hemp oil as well, for actually rolling it out. 

121
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,640
I think the whole idea of using hemp is going to be fascinating - 

122
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,280
to see what type of flavour is going to come through. 

123
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,840
I have never had one before, so it is going to be different for me. 

124
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,520
Time is not on the bakers' side. 

125
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,440
The additional ingredients in a tea loaf risk retarding the yeast 

126
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,680
and weighing down the dough, dramatically slowing the rise. 

127
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,920
I know the bread has got to go in the oven, 

128
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,360
50 minutes before the end of the time, so then I work 

129
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,240
backwards on proving for this, proving for that, mixing for this. 

130
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,560
The quicker they can combine their ingredients... 

131
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,120
Just check that it's reached the right stage in terms of 

132
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,320
the development of the gluten. That's quite good. 

133
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,360
..the more precious time they will have for their dough to prove. 

134
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,840
I even got my clingfilm ready for my bowl, 

135
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,520
so I am trying to be organised. 

136
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,880
The panic time actually has to be now. 

137
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,880
I really have to be focused now. 

138
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,400
It needs to be properly proven, it needs to be proving very soon. 

139
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,520
This is barely a dough, it is a batter. 

140
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,360
If it rises properly, it ends up being quite light. 

141
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,040
Glenn lives in Devon, so his saffron and nutmeg tea loaf is 

142
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,960
a West Country take on a classic Italian sweet bread. 

143
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,840
I wanted to do something that was regional, 

144
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,920
so I married the flavours of the Cornish saffron bun with panettone. 

145
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,520
- That sounds like an adventure to me. 
- It is, yeah. 

146
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,720
True panettone - how are you going to cool it? 

147
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,080
I am not going to cool it upside down, 

148
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,200
because I haven't got the structure. 

149
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,760
So when you say panettone, 

150
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,720
what you're actually talking about is a panettone tin. 

151
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,680
Calling it panettone, you're in trouble from him. 

152
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,320
I like to do signature bakes that are true to me 

153
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,760
and true to my upbringing. 

154
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,800
I think Mary would have been a little bit upset 

155
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,120
and disappointed if I wasn't going to make Bara Brith, 

156
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,160
to be honest with you. 

157
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,760
Beca's classic Welsh Bara Brith is straight out of her 

158
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,800
grandmother's cookbook, but the pressure of the bake off is 

159
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,120
beginning to make her question her family recipes. 

160
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,680
I find it difficult to mix 

161
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,600
the fruit into the dough after its first prove. 

162
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,840
Does it matter when I add the fruit to the dough? 

163
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,120
- Yeah, I've got my way of doing it. 
- Care to share that? 

164
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,040
- He's not going to tell you! 
- I can't tell you. 

165
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,920
- It's not fair for me to tell you now.
- OK. 

166
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,440
- I'll tell you after, and the reason why. Good luck, Beca.
- Thank you. 

167
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,200
- Thank you.
- Maybe, if you're lucky, 

168
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,440
- he'll give you the answers later on.
- Doubt it! 

169
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,400
- I'm on tenterhooks! 
- I doubt it very much! 

170
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,120
To be honest, you've put it in already, 

171
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,360
- I would've put it in later. 
- Well, there we go. I knew you were going to say that. 

172
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,240
Kneading enriched dough is even more important 

173
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,680
than with a standard bread dough. 

174
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,240
My dad used to say to me 

175
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,840
when I was making dough, "Son, you've got two hands. 

176
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,280
"I am going to half your wages 

177
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,440
"because you are not using the other one." 

178
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,520
The gluten takes longer to build and must support the heavier, 

179
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,480
wetter dough as it rises. 

180
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,160
And then it needs to prove for at least an hour. 

181
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,440
Whoopsie! 

182
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,680
Now I just hope that the yeast was happy and it's all going to work. 

183
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,360
It hasn't proved as much as I was hoping. 

184
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,920
"You shouldn't have put the fruit in first." 

185
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,040
I think the fruit has inhibited the first rise a little bit. 

186
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,520
I think you can put fruit in before it has its first prove, 

187
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,320
but it slows it down because it, literally, weighs it down 

188
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,360
and as well, because I have so much citrus zest, 

189
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,720
that acidity can interfere with the yeast, so it's better for me 

190
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,640
to leave it till after that first prove. 

191
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,080
Ruby's citrus tea loaf is flavoured with oranges and lemons, 

192
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,120
glazed with a bitter orange marmalade 

193
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,280
and topped with freshly candied orange and lemon slices. 

194
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,480
I have had to plan it down to the second because I don't want another 

195
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,640
one of those challenges where I am rushing around at the last-minute. 

196
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,720
At the moment, 

197
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,240
I am actually a couple of minutes ahead of schedule, so that's good. 

198
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,120
Ruby, Christine and Beca are all relying on traditional bread tins 

199
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,160
to shape their loaves. 

200
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,920
This is quite important. I want a nice smooth top. 

201
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,680
Howard has bravely opted for a looser approach. 

202
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,800
Just get this into a reasonably round cob shape. 

203
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,760
But Kimberley and Frances are even more ambitious. 

204
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,200
I'm going to flatten it out, spread a spice butter through it. 

205
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,920
I am just going to spread over the sugar, cinnamon, 

206
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,920
a bit of cardamom, a bit of ginger - 

207
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,240
all the flavours you would get in chai. 

208
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,120
And now I'm just going to make a sausage, 

209
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,160
cut that into three, plait it and then shape that into the tin. 

210
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,080
Now I sort of coil it up, a bit like a fan. 

211
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,880
The key thing is to try and keep it quite tight, 

212
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,880
but I have been finding at home, sometimes the swirl is so tight, 

213
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,520
it disappears. 

214
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,560
Perfect! 

215
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,520
- After one final prove...
- Urgh! It doesn't look enough at all. 

216
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,080
I suppose it's there. And I want it to come to there. 

217
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,000
..the bakers should've ensured they have enough remaining time 

218
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,760
- for their tea loaves to bake evenly.
- Go on, little bun. 

219
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:58,800
I can just hear his voice now. "Under-proved. Under-worked." 

220
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,120
The Welsh speciality Bara Brith is not just a tea loaf, 

221
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,800
it is a source of national pride. 

222
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,720
In 1865, the speckled loaf was transformed in a place far, 

223
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,040
far from the green valleys of home. 

224
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,440
During the late 1700s, towns like Blaenavon 

225
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,960
in the Welsh Valleys were transformed into centres 

226
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,360
of industry, mined for their natural resources. 

227
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,840
Families came from all over Wales to find work 

228
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,640
and lived in purpose-built houses. 

229
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,480
Families were packed into these 

230
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,000
tiny cottages with a tiny little fireplace, 

231
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,240
boiling water on one side and an oven on the other side, 

232
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,160
as the cooking facilities were really limited. 

233
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,360
With such a small oven, it was impossible to bake enough bread 

234
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,120
to feed the whole family, so the workers shared big communal ovens. 

235
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,360
They would bake lots of bread for the whole week 

236
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,680
and at the end of baking day, there was a tiny bit of dough left 

237
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,520
and currants and sultanas, raisins and spice 

238
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,920
and sugar were poked into the dough, 

239
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,200
and that is the beginning of Bara Brith, or speckled bread. 

240
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,080
The recipe for Bara Brith has many regional variations across Wales. 

241
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,080
However, the core ingredients of tea, 

242
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,520
raisins and currants remain the same. 

243
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,280
But one variation of Bara Brith can trace its origins much 

244
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,320
further afield. 

245
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,400
My great-grandfather Thomas Austin was one of 

246
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:24,880
153 people who emigrated from Wales to Patagonia in 1865. 

247
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,600
The majority of the settlers had come from industrial towns 

248
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,240
and had little knowledge of how to work the land. 

249
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,640
They relied on trade with two local tribes, 

250
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,200
the Pampas and the Tehuelches 

251
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,560
to provide them with everyday ingredients, 

252
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,240
resulting in a reinvention of the Bara Brith. 

253
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,640
As you can see, this cake is much darker than the Bara Brith. 

254
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,760
That is why the settlers called it torta negra, which means black cake. 

255
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,360
Wheat was in short supply so to help it last in the heat, 

256
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,600
the torta negra was filled with molasses and even more fruit 

257
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,880
and nuts than the Bara Brith. But this wasn't the only difference. 

258
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,160
To make Bara Brith, they soak the fruit in tea. 

259
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,360
The new version is soaked overnight in rum. 

260
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,080
Recipes for Bara Brith and torta negra have been 

261
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,440
passed down through generations and are still enjoyed 

262
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,880
today in both the Welsh Valleys and the plains of Patagonia. 

263
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,760
Bakers, that's half an hour left on your loaves. Half an hour left. 

264
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,120
Oh, that looks lovely! 

265
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,280
- I could cry.
- Why? 
- It should be higher than that. 

266
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,760
Should it? I think mine's spread. Mine has gone splat. 

267
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,960
You have said in the past, "This is going to be terrible," 

268
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,440
and it has come out fine. 

269
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,160
No, it won't, Mel. It's not going to be fine. 

270
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,160
- It is so frustrating!
- Come on, punch it out. Right. I'll hold him. 

271
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,400
Come on! That's good. Get out the tension. 

272
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,520
Glenn has also found a way to distract himself. 

273
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,640
I have changed my plans. 

274
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,120
I am rigging up a contraption to allow me 

275
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,480
to cool my panettone upside down 

276
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,520
in the traditional style, hinted at by Paul's question, 

277
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,440
"How will you be cooling your panettone?" 

278
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,880
Panettone is lighter than standard sweet breads, 

279
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,240
so unless Glenn can rest it upside down, 

280
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,160
he risks it sinking as it cools. 

281
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,280
My late stepdad, 

282
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,040
he had boundless belief in the ability of a bloke and some 

283
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:44,640
string or some gaffer tape or a wire clothes hook and he would fix, or 

284
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,000
attempt to fix, and usually manage to fix pretty much anything with 

285
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,480
one or all of those three ingredients. 

286
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,360
Linton, if you are watching, this botched job is in your honour. 

287
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,400
Beautiful! 

288
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,520
OK, bakers, glaze those sweet breads, 

289
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,800
you have 15 minutes. Just 15 minutes left. 

290
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,880
Oh, no. It's terribly wrong. It has split. 

291
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,400
It's under-proved, that's why it's split. 

292
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:17,440
- Oh, that has come out clean.
- Yes! 
- Right.
- That looks amazing. 

293
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,200
Is it going to fall through? 

294
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,840
Slightly scary when you did that, mate. Is that... Is that... 

295
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,760
- deep in enough? It's not just all going to...
- It's going to be fine. 

296
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,200
- It's going to be fine.
- OK. 

297
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,760
It just looks very amateurish, not what I wanted. 

298
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,800
All in all, not a good bake. 

299
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,520
Look. It's like a little bottom! 

300
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,000
That is marvellous! 

301
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,600
OK, bakers, time is up on your Signature Challenge. 

302
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Please put the tea loaves at the end of your benches. 

303
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,880
Give me a hug, Howard. Give me a hug. 

304
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,440
HOWARD CHUCKLES 

305
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,600
Each of the tea loaves will now be judged by Paul and Mary. 

306
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,880
You start with your eyes and that looks... Wow! I want to taste that. 

307
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,360
I love this deep citrus flavour. 

308
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,280
I think your oven was too hot 

309
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,320
because it's slightly doughy inside, 

310
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,000
but the flavours are excellent 

311
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,520
and it is a great flavour inside and it looks good. 

312
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,040
Thank you very much, Ruby. 

313
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,680
- It looks as though it's going to be rather good for me.
- Right. 

314
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,480
The hemp itself is quite pungent in the end in spice, which 

315
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,920
- I don't like. It sort of dries out your palate.
- It is different. 

316
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,360
- OK, thank you.
- Thank you. 

317
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,480
- There is a bit of spring back. 
- It has been mixed properly. 

318
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,200
I like the addition of the cranberries. 

319
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,760
That is the best bake you could have done 

320
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,120
- with the prove that you had.
- OK. 

321
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,320
It's a lovely colour. 

322
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,560
It is definitely under-baked. 

323
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,240
As soon as you put it in your mouth...it just goes to dough. 

324
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,680
- But the flavours are there. 
- I like that sharpness. 

325
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,560
I like the saffron, I like the orange, 

326
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,400
but unfortunately it is under-baked. 

327
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,280
- It needed longer in the oven, longer proving for sure.
- OK. 

328
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,920
- Oh, dear, it's so doughy inside and it's not well risen.
- Horrible. 

329
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,280
- I can't eat this. 
- No, I'm not surprised. 

330
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,520
It will not do my insides very good at all. 

331
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,160
The key point with an enriched dough is the proving. 

332
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,400
Several people have had difficulty in getting it done in the time. 

333
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,640
A smaller loaf takes a shorter time to rise - 

334
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,920
therefore choose a smaller loaf. 

335
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,160
- See in there?
- Mmm. 

336
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,560
- I love the flavour. 
- I love spices.
- It's delicious. 

337
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,960
The flavour is good, the idea is good, 

338
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,280
but it is under-proved and under-baked. 

339
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,120
Look at that. 

340
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,560
I really like it, just a bit boring on the outside, 

341
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,080
but inside it's well baked. 

342
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,520
The flavour of the cinnamon is good, it doesn't overwhelm 

343
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,280
because of the blend of the sugar as well. 

344
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,160
I think it's a very attractive loaf. 

345
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,960
We are always very excited when you do something totally original. 

346
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,520
- Thank you.
- Lovely. 
- Thank you very much. 

347
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,560
I think for once, actually, 

348
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,800
I could have done with a bit more style as far as the bit on the top. 

349
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,160
I was thinking icing sugar. 

350
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,920
I did it at home a little bit, with an icing sugar stencil, 

351
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,200
but I think I was just like, "It might over-gild that teacup." 

352
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,720
Ugh! It's really frustrating. Just... 

353
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,720
So frustrated that I just don't seem to be able to 

354
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,720
nail the signature bakes. 

355
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,320
It didn't work at all at home, 

356
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,960
so at least it's an improvement on that. 

357
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,160
Positives, find the positives. 

358
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,560
I have no idea what went wrong. 

359
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,560
I made it exactly the same as I had at home, 

360
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,960
both times it's gone right. 

361
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,400
It's bread, it's baking, it's what it does. 

362
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,640
'One sweet dough challenge down, two remaining for the bakers. 

363
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,800
'Their next is a total mystery.' 

364
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,880
Welcome to your beloved technical challenge. 

365
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,200
You will be pleased to hear this afternoon 

366
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,000
that it is one of Paul's recipes. 

367
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,720
So, before he says something that we all might regret, 

368
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,600
Paul, Mary, off you go. 

369
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,760
So, the technical challenge this afternoon is an apricot couronne. 

370
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,240
A traditional French sweet loaf. 

371
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,560
We need enriched dough, apricots, twisted, 

372
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,920
then formed into a crown shape. 

373
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,640
You have got two-and-three-quarter hours in which to bake it, 

374
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,040
- so on your marks...
- Get set... BOTH:
- Bake. 

375
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,880
I know what they look like, so hopefully I can replicate one. 

376
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,400
I think it's like a sort of twisted, round thing. 

377
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,880
I think you do it a bit like a Swiss roll or a Chelsea bun 

378
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,480
and then you split it in half. 

379
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,200
I might as well be doing this entire challenge like this, 

380
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,520
because that is how much of an idea I have. 

381
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,240
An old favourite, Mary. An apricot couronne. 

382
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,280
It looks absolutely beautiful. 

383
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,840
- Would you like to try some, Mary? 
- I would. 

384
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,680
- It's absolutely delicious. 
- I hope they don't mess up my recipe. 

385
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,160
The first thing they have got to do is prepare the dough. 

386
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,920
Once it's risen, they have to roll it out into a rectangle, 

387
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,320
then they smother the filling on the top. This is the tricky bit. 

388
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,480
I knew there must be something tricky. 

389
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,000
Once the filling has gone in, they have to cut down the middle 

390
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,160
of the length of the bread dough itself 

391
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,200
and expose all the interior, and then twist it together 

392
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,360
and then join it together to form a halo. 

393
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,040
Have you told them how long to bake it, or is that up to them? 

394
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,320
- No, that is entirely up to them. 
- You're very cruel.
- Oh, yes. 

395
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,600
This doesn't fill me with dread like others do. So, that's positive. 

396
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,080
'Enriched couronne dough is a mixture of flour, 

397
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,720
'yeast, salt, butter and eggs.' 

398
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,920
Have you got any more milk? 

399
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,680
'Milk is used instead of water to break down the chemical structure 

400
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,600
'which should result in a light dough.' 

401
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,200
I think it needs to be working for 8-10 minutes. It feels nice. 

402
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,520
'The bakers must knead their dough well, or their sweet couronnes 

403
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,720
'will spread out flat instead of rise.' 

404
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,840
It is getting there, but it's not there yet. 

405
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,720
Do you think they'll notice those two grams 

406
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,840
I just threw on the floor? 

407
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,320
I'm scared this is a sign. 

408
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,240
'As their dough proves... 

409
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,560
Can I use the oven, rather than the drawer? 

410
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,840
'..the bakers should prepare their filling.' 

411
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,640
Cream, butter and sugar, and mix in the remaining ingredients. 

412
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,080
So, we've got apricots, there's flour, 

413
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,280
raisins, walnuts and orange zest. 

414
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,720
We have ignition. 

415
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,760
It is such a relief to see my dough rising, 

416
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,640
which I didn't see this morning. 

417
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,480
'Paul's recipe doesn't state how long to prove the dough.' 

418
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,280
I'm just debating whether to be the first one 

419
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,200
to get my dough out or not. 

420
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,040
If everybody is waiting for somebody else to do it, 

421
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,960
then we might be here all night. 

422
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,040
So, I'm thinking, should I go for it? 

423
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,520
I'm thinking that's probably ready to start working. 

424
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,760
It just says, roll out the dough into a rectangle. 

425
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,760
Near enough a rectangle to me. 

426
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,800
Then it says, spread the apricot mixture over the dough. 

427
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,480
It's all guesswork. 

428
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,880
Roll up the dough and then cut it in half. 

429
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,560
How do you roll it up and then cut it into two? 

430
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,400
Do you roll it that way, am I reading this right? Oh, gosh. 

431
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,240
I think I am going to have to go with it. 

432
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,760
'Unless they roll the dough tightly and evenly...' 

433
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,720
You won't want to be chewing through half an inch of filling. 

434
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,440
'..the couronne will lose its distinctive layers.' 

435
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,080
OK, rolled, all good. 

436
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,960
- What's next?
- Cut. 
- So, you're leaving a bit at the top. 

437
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,600
Twist the two dough lengths together. 

438
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,440
Does it mean twist over each other, twist round? 

439
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,080
I hadn't thought about that. Twist the two together. 

440
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,240
- Twist the two together, my love. 
- OK, so that means do that. 

441
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,360
Why are you keeping the filling upright? 

442
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,720
Because that's just the way I've seen it. 

443
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,280
That looks crown-like, doesn't it? 

444
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,600
Something that Robert Powell would be happy to wear. 

445
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,880
Do it tight. 

446
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,440
'Without a second prove, the twist will inhibit the dough's 

447
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,960
'rise in the oven, resulting in a dense couronne.' 

448
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,320
I believe this giant bag may have something to do with it. 

449
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,040
'But without a cover, 

450
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,360
'a skin will form, causing the surface 

451
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,960
'to become tough and leathery when baked.' 

452
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,240
- Is that going to work? 
- Yeah.
- Prove it. 

453
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,280
THEY LAUGH 

454
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,920
Oh, hello. That's a crown and a half. 

455
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,440
It's a bit big, isn't it? 

456
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,440
I've just seen Howard's. 

457
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,360
It's not big enough. Howard's - twice as big. 

458
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,800
That's what it should look like, not that. 

459
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,040
How long have you got left? 

460
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,120
I don't know how long I've got left cos I don't know how long I need. 

461
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,480
From the picture I remember, 

462
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,520
I don't remember seeing loads of filling coming out. 

463
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,560
- I could be wrong. 
- It sounds harder than it is. 

464
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,400
It's just a Chelsea bun by any other name. 

465
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,640
Yeah. Truly. 

466
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,880
Of course, it says "bake". 

467
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,720
What does that mean, bake? 

468
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,360
Bakers, that's half an hour left on your couronnes. 

469
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,800
I put a hat on it because it was browning too quickly, 

470
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,760
which worries me. 

471
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,360
I think because I've got more cuts on it than some people, 

472
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,440
so my filling is more exposed, 

473
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,280
it means the sugar in the filling is browning more quickly. 

474
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,240
I just need to keep an eye on that. 

475
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,080
I've not done too bad for time, which is why I am slightly 

476
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,680
unsure why everybody else seems to be a little bit behind me. 

477
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,480
- Heaven forbid, I might have got it right!
- Couronne, that looks good. 

478
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,320
That's quite a turban-esque type of crown. 

479
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,040
- Yes, I didn't want it to spill out too much filling.
- Sure. 

480
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,840
I'm happy the shape has got a nice twist to it. 

481
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,960
Five minutes left, bakers, 

482
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,520
and the crowns need to be at the ends of the benches. 

483
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,000
Doesn't glazing transform everything? 

484
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,080
It's kind of hypnotic after a while, isn't it? 

485
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,520
Bakers, time is up. Couronnes on your boards, please. 

486
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,480
Now your rings must face the judgment of Paul. 

487
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,840
'Paul and Mary will have no idea who made which couronne.' 

488
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,560
Actually, looking at these, they all look pretty good, 

489
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,320
but we have got to try it first. 

490
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,880
- For you to say they're all looking pretty good...
- Don't start, Mary. 

491
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,960
Let's just start over here. 

492
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,760
I quite like this one, see the way the filling is all exposed, 

493
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,600
- the icing is good on it, as well. 
- It's a good bake underneath too. 

494
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,880
Good amount of filling in there, 

495
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,680
great texture, good bake, nice colour. 

496
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,200
Moving onto the next one, not much filling exposed, 

497
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,440
you can see little bits. 

498
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,120
They could have done with slightly more open twists. 

499
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,160
Not quite as even, this end is thin, this end is thick. 

500
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,760
Not as much orange coming through in that one. 

501
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,320
Again, this is a little bit too thin, it needs to be thicker. 

502
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,200
They have rolled it out too much. The bake looks good. 

503
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,760
It's really full of fruit. 

504
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,680
Moving onto this one, the icing is good, almonds, good. 

505
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,320
It's exposing the filling, which I like as well. 

506
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,640
Nice texture, the fruit is fairly even. 

507
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,440
A bit thin, this one. 

508
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,000
You can see where the filling is exposed on the outside 

509
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,720
and not all the way through. 

510
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,520
It just goes to show that it wasn't spread evenly. 

511
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,920
Now this one, with all this open side 

512
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,640
showing through, makes it look more tempting and delicious. 

513
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,560
Nice size, and it's quite even all the way round. 

514
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,080
- Good icing, that is a nice couronne. 
- It looks almost perfect. 

515
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,880
Moving on to the last one. 

516
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,440
A bit too much icing on that, you can't see what is going on. 

517
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,040
- It needs to be lighter, it's a bit clumsy on the icing.
- Well baked. 

518
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,400
It is well baked, yeah. You can see the filling, it's unusual. 

519
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,520
- It's not really even.
- But what a good batch we've had this time. 

520
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,080
I'm impressed, they're all baked, they all tasted good. 

521
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,640
This is going to be difficult to judge. 

522
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,280
'But whose couronne will see them crowned winner 

523
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,520
'of the sweet dough technical challenge?' 

524
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,840
In seventh place is this one, whose is this? 

525
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,280
It was too thin, all the filling was round the outside 

526
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,080
and it could have done with a slightly deeper colour as well. 

527
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,280
And in sixth place, this one here. 

528
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,040
This is a little bit clumsy 

529
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,600
and the distribution of the fruit is not very even. 

530
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,920
'Glenn is fifth, Christine fourth, and Kimberley secures third place.' 

531
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,760
In second place, who is that? 

532
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,800
The flavour was there, lovely finish, good colour. 

533
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,200
And in first place is this one. 

534
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,240
APPLAUSE 

535
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,320
Well done, Ruby. 

536
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,000
Excellent ripple all the way through, filling's all exposed. 

537
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,480
That looks like the one I would have done, well done. 

538
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,320
I'm so proud of myself, 

539
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,480
I never thought I would get first in a technical, so I'm really happy. 

540
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,200
They all looked and tasted great so a good technical all-round. 

541
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,040
All-round a couronne. That's how you say it. 

542
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,200
Mary said it was a bit clumsy, but I'm not bothered, to be honest. 

543
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,440
It was baked, it tasted good, there was a good colour. 

544
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,240
I think they just didn't like the thick icing, which is fine. 

545
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,360
I quite like the thick icing. 

546
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,720
Oh! That was really annoying! 

547
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,400
So frustrating because it was the first technical bake that I've enjoyed. 

548
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,360
'For their third and final challenge, Paul and Mary have made a change.' 

549
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,640
Now, bakers, normally after the technical challenge 

550
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,200
we would send you home. 

551
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,240
But it's sweet dough week and we know these take time, 

552
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,840
so we are going to set you off 

553
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,120
on your Showstopper Challenge right now, this evening. 

554
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,960
We need you to make two different varieties of European sweet buns. 

555
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,040
12 of each. 

556
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,400
These can be either French brioche or a German schnecken. 

557
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,520
Basically, this challenge is Nigel Farage's worst nightmare. 

558
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,800
You have 30 minutes to start your dough tonight 

559
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,960
and that's in advance of a four-hour bake tomorrow. 

560
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,560
- So, on your marks...
- Get set... BOTH:
- Bake. 

561
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,160
'Most of the bakers are attempting brioche. 

562
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,400
'The large amount of eggs and butter in the dough 

563
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,920
'means a long, slow prove is crucial.' 

564
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,960
By the time you have added all the eggs, all the butter, 

565
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,240
the dough is sloppy. It's like a batter. 

566
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,360
So you chill the dough for 12 hours, that solidifies the butter, 

567
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,000
then it becomes a malleable dough, then you can shape it. 

568
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,320
It needs to rest for a minimum 8-12 hours, realistically. 

569
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,120
They have got to be organised and creative. 

570
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,720
They have got to make full use of this half-hour. 

571
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,080
Would have liked longer, but, you know... 

572
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,800
I am adding in the zest of an orange and lemon. 

573
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,360
I think the flavours help, sitting there overnight. 

574
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:13,680
I am making a apricot and almond brioche. 

575
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,440
The chocolate one is a brioche, 

576
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,000
but I have added melted chocolate to the mix. 

577
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,080
I have got saffron in my dough 

578
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,720
which gives it quite a nice, yellowy colour. 

579
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,000
It has been a very long day 

580
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,280
and I think we are all a little bit tired and a bit weary now. 

581
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,360
Hopefully, it'll have a good night. 

582
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,560
'Four hours remaining. 

583
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,120

'the bakers can allow their dough even more time to prove.' 

585
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,400
I'm toasting my almonds at the moment, which 

586
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,880
I must not forget about, otherwise they will burn. 

587
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:55,760
These are my prunes that have been soaking in rum for about five days. 

588
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,720
When I was thinking about flavours I wanted something quite rich. 

589
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,560
I just thought, let's use a bit of booze. 

590
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,200

- It's beautiful.
- He's an expert in buns. 

594
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,960
I like iced buns, yeah. 

595
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,000
I am an expert in eating them as well, if I'm honest. 

596
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,680
I'm just measuring out some golden syrup 

597
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,640
and that's going into this, which is butter and brown sugar. 

598

- It does. 
- Lovely.

613

They are kind of perfect for a quick marmalade 

637
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,800
because they are both sweet and sour. 

638
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,600
And the skins are so thin, they are edible anyway. 

639
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,240
You are supposed to eat them whole. 

640

So I don't have to boil them down for two hours before I get started, 

641

655
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,640
Howard is really interesting flavour combinations. 

656
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,480
I like to see Howard as a maverick. 

657
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,280
He will not be tamed. 

658
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,840
He is the wild one. Christine? 

659
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,160
Christine, absolutely consistent. 

660
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,000
Your intonation slightly changed there, I think 

661
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,880
Christine might worry you. And what about Frances? 

662
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,920
Frances is just our design guru - gem, she's amazing. 

663
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,600
- You really have profiled everyone, haven't you?
- Yeah. 

664
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,760
There really is... 

665
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,280
I'm imagining a dungeon, or a basement level, certainly. Just faces. 

666
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,440
I'm not going to look you in the eye now, 

667
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,400
I'm just going to walk away slowly. 

668
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,880
- Listen, have a good bake.
- Thanks. 

669
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,160
OK, bakers, you're halfway through. 

670
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,040
It's very much in the baking interval. 

671
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,280
Bring out the dancing girls with the segmented oranges. Half-time. 

672
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,320
'The sweet dough has to be rolled, filled 

673
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,240
'and shaped quickly enough to allow time for a crucial second prove.' 

674
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,680
I am just going to spread on the prune. 

675
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,400
Look at that, that's like a visual of nappy change time, isn't it? 

676
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,960
- Smell it.
- Oh, is there alcohol in that? Goodbye. 

677
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,480
This is the dough for my cardamom buns. 

678
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,120
That's like a cardamom butter. 

679
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,920
When I'm at home, I'm kind of watching TV 

680
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,480
and that whilst I'm baking. 

681
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,800
I take a break every now and again, then I get distracted. 

682
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,120
I never bake with this sort of concentration or speed, ever. 

683
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,320
'Ruby's lemon and chocolate twisted buns are her 

684
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,560
'take on the Swedish kanelbullar. 

685
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:08,320
'She's also making saffron-scented St Lucia buns filled with currants.' 

686
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:13,160
Just about to start shaping, I have to twist like this 

687
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:18,680
and then cross them over. And then they keep that twist. 

688
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,040
I might just make them a tiny bit smaller, 

689
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,760
I just need to cut off the ends. 

690
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,440
Paul and Mary will be expecting both sets of buns to be 

691
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,320
uniform in both appearance and size. 

692
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,440
Half of nine is four and a half. 

693
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,880
Threes into four and a half is one and a half, isn't it? 

694
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,560
Oh, that's worked out perfectly. 

695
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,440
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. 

696
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,480
But where's the twelfth one gone? What's wrong with me? 

697
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,720
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 

698
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,760
nine, ten, eleven, twelve. 

699
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,080
You're playing with my mind! 

700
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,520
I feel good coming on the back of yesterday's bakes, 

701
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,320
but I just seem to have a track record of doing two out of three, 

702
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,400
so it would be nice to sort of get the hat-trick. 

703
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,440
Frances has devised a giant baked game of noughts and crosses. 

704
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,560
Her fruity cinnamon hot-cross brioche 

705
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,960
will be joined by her kolache noughts. 

706
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,160
- Tell me about the kolache. 
- Yes, what is a kolache? 

707
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,760
So, it's a Czech sweet bun and I'm filling that with rhubarb 

708
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,600
and then a little bit of strawberry, just to get a bit more colour 

709
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,960
going on in there, and then covering it in a creme pat, 

710
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,000
baking them in the oven and then glazing them slightly, as well. 

711
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,640
- Good luck, see you later.
- Thank you. 

712
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,640
The bakers have just one hour left to prove 

713
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,120
and bake all 24 of their shaped and filled sweet buns. 

714
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,680
I'm looking for elevation. 

715
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,800
Well, don't you forget, they're going in here. Oh, hello. 

716
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,360
That was a kolache on the head. 

717
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,840
Erm... 

718
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,080
I don't know what you're talking about. 

719
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,760
Bath is famous for its history, architecture 

720
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,720
and of course, its baths. 

721
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,720
But it's also become renowned for a brioche-type bake which was 

722
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,880
the bun de jour for the Georgian chattering classes. 

723
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,440
Throughout the 18th century, 

724
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,840
the aristocracy flocked to spa towns like Bath for the healing waters 

725
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,080
and to indulge in fine food in exclusive surroundings. 

726
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,000
For the Georgian glitterati, there was 

727
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,360
only one bun to be seen eating and that was the Sally Lunn. 

728
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,720
A brioche whose life, it is said, 

729
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,480
began in Lilliput Alley 100 years earlier. 

730
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,520
The Sally Lunn is said to be named after 

731
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,760
its French creator, Solange Luyon, 

732
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,160
who changed her name to make it easier for the English to understand. 

733
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,320
Who was Sally Lunn and why were her buns so famous? 

734
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,360
The legend is that she was a French Huguenot refugee, 

735
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,720
- fleeing the troubles in France... 
- OK.
- ..who arrived here at some point 

736
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,080
at the end of the 17th century, set up shop here, started selling 

737
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,600
fortified French brioche-style buns and thus a legend was born. 

738
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,320
So, how did Sally, or Solange, go about actually making these buns? 

739
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,080
They are basically a brioche dough, 

740
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,800
so, butter, milk or cream, eggs, sugar and then baking them in 

741
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,640
what we call today a faggot oven, 

742
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,760
which is effectively a brick-built structure, 

743
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,120
put in your buns, let your buns cook, open the door... 

744
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,920
- Boom.
- Bun heaven.
- Hot buns. 

745
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,400
100 years after its introduction to Bath, 

746
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,120
the Sally Lunn went on to become the toast of the town when it became 

747
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,040
the bun of choice for those who visited the 

748
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,840
pleasure gardens of Georgian Bath. 

749
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,480
So, what was the deal with pleasure gardens and the Georgians? 

750
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,840
Why were they such a sensation? 

751
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,480
They were sort of a unique space where everybody would come for 

752
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,120
public breakfasts or evening galas. 

753
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,400
It is all about wearing your finest clothes and 

754
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,600
coming and meeting people, all of Bath society coming here. 

755
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,360
- And showing off. 
- And showing off. 

756
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,440
Wealthy visitors paid to enter these landscaped gardens 

757
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,520
and were entertained with live music, fairground rides and a labyrinth. 

758
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,960
They would dine outdoors, eating fine food, 

759
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,880
served at what were known as public breakfasts. 

760
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,480
I'm guessing that the Sally Lunn bun would have featured quite 

761
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,160
heavily in the public breakfasts, is that right? 

762
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,320
- Absolutely, the Sally Lunn bun was served here.
- How was it served? 

763
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,280
- They would split them open... 
- Oh, ripping?
- Rip them open. 

764
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,800
Oh, I like that. 

765
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,080
- Oh, that's a lovely smell, isn't it? 
- Yes, it's lovely. 

766
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,880
- And what would you have eaten with it?
- Lots of lovely, fresh butter. 

767
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,080
Which was very expensive in the 18th century, so very fine, white bread, 

768
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,360
lovely, fresh butter. 

769
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:16,720
Matthew, I'm going in, I'm sorry, do you mind? 

770
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,000
- Good?
- That's really nice. They're very, very delicious. 

771
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,400
Sally Lunn, I salute you and your hot buns. 

772
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,080
- GERMAN ACCENT:
- Achtung, my lovely bakers, 

773
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,120
you have half an hour for your sweet buns. 

774
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,440
They are ready for the oven. 

775
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,800
I'm laying some spoons across the top of these, 

776
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,720
so that when they're baked in the oven, 

777
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,120
you get a little bit of the cleft that you would normally 

778
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,360
get in a peach. 

779
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,080
Due to their small size, 

780
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,960
baking times for buns is perilously short. 

781
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,680
Just one minute out could ruin both colour and texture. 

782
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,160
And both batches will bake at a completely different speed. 

783
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,520
- Hello.
- Some are browning at a different rate than others, 

784
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,400
so I'm going to swap them over. 

785
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,080
I wouldn't usually mess around with this, 

786
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,920
but I'd like them all to be as similar as possible. 

787
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,560
Never known buns that big. 

788
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,240
Five minutes - the bun countdown has begun. 

789
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:38,640
Everything is still fine, time wise. There's going to be no panic. 

790
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,200
Who am I kidding? 

791
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,800
I'm going to be close to the wire with my schnecken. 

792
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,000
Look how much smaller mine are than other people's! 

793
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,760
I'm happy with those, but those are monsters, so... 

794
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,520
- How beastly are they?
- Very. 

795
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,240
Bakers, you've got one minute left on your buns. 

796
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,440
They aren't out. 

797
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,200
Just do it upside down now. 

798
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:34,280
- Oh, no, that was a crap idea.
- Sorry. 
- OK.
- I'm stepping out. 

799
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,560
Bakers, that's it, time is literally up. 

800
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,240
Come on, over the bench. Some over-bench loving. 

801
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,200
- Thank you.
- Go on. 

802
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,560
I came into today thinking that I've got to have a good showstopper. 

803
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,360
And I feel I've done that. 

804
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,800
The flavours in that, the textures are good. 

805
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,120
- Almost like a doughnut, only much more fun.
- Yes, yes. 

806
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,720
And of course, baked in the oven. 

807
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,080
You've got that hit of the jam and the custard, as well. 

808
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,480
I do like them a lot. 

809
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,440
You've got a lovely whack of fruit in there. 

810
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,960
I think those are absolutely scrummy, really moist, nice texture. 

811
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,760
That's delicious and a nice blend of the cinnamon as well, 

812
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,760
and the caramel really works as a sugar. 

813
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,720
- I'm impressed, I think they're very nice.
- Thank you.
- Well done. 

814
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,560
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you. 

815
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,120
I have never, ever created buns as big as that. 

816
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,800
They're like buns on steroids. 

817
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,840
You'd certainly get your money's worth if I was 

818
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,600
selling them in a bakery. 

819
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,720
It does taste lovely and they are baked well, 

820
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,640
but they are over-proved. You can see that, 

821
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,240
because they've risen and obviously they've just collapsed. 

822
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,640
Oh. 

823
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,280
That's good. Quite different. Really nice. 

824
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,040
- It's just a shame about the hot cross bun.
- I know. 

825
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,840
The peachy buns turned out better than they've done in practice, 

826
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,240
so I'm quite pleased with that. 

827
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:42,480
I'm hoping that the flavour is as good as the appearance. 

828
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,880
They really look inviting, don't they? 

829
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,520
They do look just like peaches, I think they're fantastic. 

830
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,960
- I can't taste the peach. 
- Oh, right.
- It's dissolved. 

831
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,840
- No, there's definitely no peach. 
- Right. 

832
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,600
- The bake's good, though, but it is quite bland.
- Right, OK. 

833
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,160
It's very dry. 

834
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,080
All the butter's fallen out the dough 

835
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,720
and left a biscuit-like finish. 

836
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,760
- Right, OK.
- Thank you.
- Thanks. 

837
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,280
- I'm sorry.
- Why? 

838
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,920
I don't know what I was thinking, I just left them in the oven and they're like biscuits. 

839
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,520
They would have been good last week. 

840
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,080
You always come looking forlorn and saying, "If only..." 

841
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:52,160
- Don't tell us too much, we'll make up our minds.
- Hold it back, Rubes. 

842
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,600
Yeah, exactly. 

843
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,520
- They're delicious.
- They are. 

844
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,840
The flavours in there are amazing, you've got the crunch, as well. 

845
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,520
- I don't think they're over-baked, actually.
- Wow. 

846
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,800
- I was expecting them to be really dry.
- So was I. 

847
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,400
Especially as you'd warned us that they were going to be dry. 

848
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,560
- Let that be a lesson learnt.
- OK. 

849
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,880
I like these. I do. 

850
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,560
- I'm impressed.
- Thank you. 
- Thanks, Ruby. 

851
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:51,120
I would say they needed longer proving, they needed more rise. 

852
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,520
- Not overwhelmed with the flavour. 
- OK. 

853
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,120
- I'm not getting the almond cream, are you getting it?
- No, no. 

854
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,040
I'm not getting almond cream at all. 

855
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,040
Let's have a look at one of these chocolate brioches. 

856
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,080
I love the chocolate flavour. 

857
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:07,160
- But I think they're a little under-baked in the middle.
- OK. 

858
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,080
I feel absolutely idiotic. 

859
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,720
They just look shocking. 

860
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,400
I'll give you a fair crack of the whip 

861
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,200
and go for the one in the middle. 

862
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,000
Sadly, this is something that really hasn't worked. 

863
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,320
What you've actually got is a very, very sharp, sour-tasting cinnamon. 

864
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,600
- It doesn't taste good, have you tried one of these yet?
- No. 

865
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,000
You need to try one of these. 

866
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,240
Let's try the brioche. 

867
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,960
Apricot has just been plonked on the top like that. They look awful. 

868
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,920
Let's hope they taste good. 

869
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:13,440
They taste good, but they're dry. Even with that lovely filling. 

870
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,160
It's a pity. Overcooked. 

871
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,760
- Thank you.
- Thank you. 

872
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,800
I do like the look of these guys, these look fantastic. 

873
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,680
Let's have a look at the brioche. 

874
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,440
Great brioche. 

875
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,800
Adding a prune, which is sharp and hits it, just overwhelms everything. 

876
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,920
- It doesn't go with a very, very nice brioche.
- Yeah. 

877
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,760
I'm not sure about that sort of look on top of an iced bun. 

878
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,080
- I love iced buns. 
- Traditionalist, yeah? 

879
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,640
I like the lemon icing. 

880
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,720
The bake on it is excellent, the texture's good - 

881
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,040
- it's a nice iced bun. 
- Good, thank you. 

882
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,520
Paul and Mary must now decide who will be this week's Star Baker 

883
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,960
and whose Bake Off has come to an end. 

884
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,440
OK, so, overall, there are a couple of people that excelled. 

885
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,600
Firstly, Frances. 

886
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,120
Has she still done enough to merit potentially Star Baker? 

887
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,920
I think she's done well. Her rhubarb and custard were delicious. 

888
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,320
But I think Ruby, too, you know, there she arrived, 

889
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,840
all forlorn, telling us she'd burnt her chocolate buns, 

890
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,600
she had not and they were absolutely scrummy. 

891
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,000
Howard, he needed to pull something out of the bag today, 

892
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,440
- do you think he's done that? 
- Those things there are over-proved. 

893
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:02,640
- And the peach ones didn't taste of peach!
- The peach had disappeared. 

894
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,000
How disappointing was that? 

895
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,480
Poor Glenn had a bit of a shocker today. 

896
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,840
He started off really well and he thought he was pacing himself. 

897
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:16,240
But he had such trouble turning out his spiral buns, they were a mess. 

898
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,160
Glenn's apricot buns were just too dry, you can't just stick apricot 

899
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,200
on the top of icing and expect it to be good. 

900
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,480
So, Paul and Mary, in terms of who leaves today, 

901
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:27,440
it seems as if there are possibly two that are up for debate? 

902
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,600
- Yeah.
- That might be going. 
- I definitely agree with that. 
- Yeah, I think so. 

903
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,240
If I'm not getting the bakes right on important things 

904
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,680
like this showstopper, it's inevitable 

905
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,400
that I'll be up for consideration, at least, to go this week. 

906
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,520
I think it's probably inevitable. 

907
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,760
And... 

908
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,400
Sorry. 

909
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,520
In about... I can't actually talk. 

910
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,480
Still can't. 

911
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,240
Well done, bakers. Really long, arduous weekend, awful lot of buns. 

912
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,520
Congratulations. 

913
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:37,320
As you know, every week, we award the accolade of Star Baker. 

914
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:40,080
And this week, Mary and Paul are a bit worried, because the person 

915
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:43,160
we wanted to give that accolade to is already pretty confident. 

916
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:46,040
I'd say almost cocky. If we gave that person this award, then maybe 

917
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:50,400
they'd just tip over into being such a grandiose and arrogant soul, 

918
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,440
but we're going to take that risk, so, 

919
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,160
congratulations, Ruby, you're Star Baker. 

920
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:58,400
APPLAUSE 

921
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,680
Bakers, you know very well how this works. 

922
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,480
We can't take everybody with us on our journey into next week. 

923
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:14,240
So, I'm afraid the person that we will be saying goodbye to is... 

924
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,560
Howard. 

925
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,480
- So sorry, Howard.
- Oh, Howard. 

926
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:33,440
Whose sponges will I elbow? I don't know. 

927
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,320
- Aww, it's been a pleasure. It's been a real pleasure.
- Thank you. 

928
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,920
Howard, unfortunately, had to go. 

929
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,800
It was such a shame, I like Howard and at the beginning 

930
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,280
he was showing real promise of being a fantastic baker. 

931
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:50,160
We don't look back - it's on the two days 

932
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:54,440
and if you don't do well throughout, I'm afraid you have to leave. 

933
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:57,200
Gosh, we'll miss you so much. 

934
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,200
It's been an absolute fantastic experience. 

935
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,000
There are people in there who I have grown very, very close to - 

936
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,360
Frances, Christine, Ruby, Glenn. But Kimberley and Beca, as well. 

937
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,920
They are all such fantastic bakers 

938
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,920
and I'm just dead chuffed that I was there with them. 

939
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,560
- PAUL:
- Well done, Ruby. 

940
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,000
Bread's the thing I like doing most, I absolutely love it, 

941
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,320
especially doing buns and stuff like this. 

942
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,160
So to get Star Baker doing something that 

943
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,040
I actually really love doing, it just feels really great. 

944
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,640
If we'd listened to you, you wouldn't be Star Baker. 

945
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,840
- You tell us too much.
- I know. 
- Keep it to yourself.
- I will. 

946
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,040
Oh, bless. 

947
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:43,160
- I just don't think that's fair, I'm so sorry.
- No, no, it's absolutely... 

948
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,440
I feel terrible, it should have been me. 

949
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,360
So now I have to do it, I have to carry on and do well. 

950
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,840
I have to get my act together. Because... 

951
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,680
..he's worked so hard and done so well. 

952
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,520
And he's gone home. 

953
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:04,000
Next time, the six remaining bakers face pastry. 

954
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,800
- It's going to be very tight.
- With a suet signature...
- That's perfecto. 

955
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:13,200
- ..that revives school dinner nightmares.
- I feel physically sick. 

956
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,520
Oh. 

957
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,280
- A holy technical... 
- Eight religieuses. 

958
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,400
- ..that's hell on earth. 
- What an ugly bunch of nuns. 

959
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,920
- And a
- showstopper... Oh, God. 

960
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,520
..leaves them out of puff. 

961
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,720
This is so stressful. 

962
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:34,400
But only five can make it through to the Bake Off quarterfinal. 

963
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,360
- Get a grip.
- Thanks.
- Just get a grip. 
- Thank you.
- OK?
- Thank you. 

964
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,880
Get a ruddy grip. 

965
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,680
