00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Welcome to this week's marquee of action, crammed full 

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,640
of whipping, caramelising, chaffing, tempering and... 

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,080
(What was the other thing?) 

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,400
- Sorry, you lost me at whipping. 
- What is that thing? 

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,480
- The Great British Bake Off. 
- Bake Off. yeah. 

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,840
We're doing whipping? I didn't bring my leather chaps. 

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,080
Whole episode of whipping. 

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,280
'Last time...' 

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,600
Go with your instinct. 

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,800
I have no instinct on fruit pies. 

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,200
'Despite Ruby stretching herself to the limit, 

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,360
'it was Kimberley's pies and tarts that saw her crowned Star Baker.' 

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,000
That is, quite frankly, delicious. 

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,240
And one of the nicest pies I've had for some years. 

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,240
'And while Glenn and Rob struggled...' 

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,280
Looks all right. 

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,720
The monster's in. 

18
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,880
'It was Ali who eventually had to bid 

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,160
'an emotional farewell to the bake-off.' 

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,560
If you don't keep in touch, I'll kill you. 

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,320
'Now the eight remaining bakers..' 

22
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,200
Maybe there's a little bit of action here. 

23
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,520
'..face the largest Signature Bake yet.' 

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,520
Umm...that. 

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,200
Don't tell me you're going to wing it! 

26
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,760
'..the thinnest technical challenge ever devised...' 

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,680
Oh, gosh, this is really hard. 

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,080
'..and a Showstopper that's so tall...' 

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,920
This is very delicate. 

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,960
'..it could topple.' 

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,920
Oh, I feel sick making this! 

32
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,280
'Britain's best home bakers.' 

33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,840
OK, is that going to stay? I am slightly concerned. 

34
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,120
'But who can make their way to Star Baker? 

35
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,560
'And whose Bake Off is about to collapse?' 

36
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,160
Je ne sais quoi. 

37
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,680
When I've done this previously, people were quite impressed. 

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,480
That was my mum and dad, though. 

39
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,920
Do you know that Britons spend almost as much annually 

40
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,880
on biscuits as they do on fruit and veg? 

41
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,240
Well, you have to make sure you get your five a day. 

42
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,160
- Shortbread.
- Tiffins. 
- Garibaldis.
- Tuiles. 

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,880
- Bourbons.
- Jammy Dodgers. 

44
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,360
Custard creams. I mean, that's six, we're doing our bit. 

45
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,520
It's biscuits and tray bakes week. Wagon Wheels. 

46
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,440
- What I love is a big brownie. 
- Yeah. 

47
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,680
Halfway point, yay! 

48
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,600
I don't know how far I can get, but I have my mother 

49
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,640
and my husband telling me to get a grip and just man up. 

50
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,840
The halfway point is a really big milestone for me. 

51
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,560
Everybody that's left in the competition is quite strong 

52
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,720
and it's going to be very hard to stay in. 

53
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,280
If there's anybody who's massively competitive, 

54
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,120
they're keeping it very quiet. 

55
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,320
I feel a little bit sort of calmer this week, 

56
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,800
I don't know how long it'll last. 

57
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,560
Bakers, welcome to your fifth week in the tent, 

58
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,240
and a classic cats and dogs British summer. 

59
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,240
Now, for this morning's Signature Challenge, we'd like you 

60
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,040
to make your favourite tray bake. Now, this can be brownies, blondies, 

61
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,440
rocky roads, although because there's a recession on, 

62
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,480
millionaire's shortbreads have been downgraded to a penny crunch. 

63
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,400
Paul and Mary have said the pieces should be identical in size, 

64
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,440
and everything you make as part of the tray bake 

65
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,040
should be from scratch, be it caramel, marshmallow, whatevs. 

66
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,800
- You've got two hours, so on your marks...
- Get set...
- Bake! 

67
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,200
'A classic British tray bake can be biscuit, cake or pastry, but must be 

68
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,560
'baked in a square or rectangular tin 

69
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,880
'and cut into neat, individual pieces.' 

70
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,440
They've got to think of something original, 

71
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,360
each layer compliments the next. 

72
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,520
If it's got a pastry base, it's got to be crisp, 

73
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,360
if they're putting a jam layer in, it's got to be the right thickness. 

74
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,640
We want some lovely surprises and wonderful finishes. 

75
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,040
For me, a tray bake is all about the flavour and also the textures. 

76
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,000
The very fact that it's a simple, often just a one mix, 

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,560
baked and cut, makes it extremely difficult, 

78
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,760
because when you're judging, you have to be even more critical. 

79
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,160
I'm just soaking the dried bananas because they're slightly chewy ones. 

80
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,240
'Howard's signature is based on a classic.' 

81
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,680
It's quite similar to a flapjack. 

82
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,200
I tend to have a slightly rustic approach to stuff, 

83
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,480
so I suppose my tray bake is going to follow that to a certain degree. 

84
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,880
'His flapjack recipe is all about the most important meal of the day.' 

85
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,600
It's got porridge oats, some puffed oats in it. 

86
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,320
The main flavour I'm trying to get is grapefruit. 

87
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,960
What's your base? How are you going to build these layers? 

88
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,080
It's all in the pan. 

89
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,200
Layer it out, bake it and I'm doing a yoghurt icing on top 

90
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,440
to give that bit of sharpness again with the grapefruit. 

91
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,880
Sounds lovely and healthy. 

92
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,280
It's probably not, because it's got quite a bit of butter 

93
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,160
and sugar in there! 

94
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,160
'Howard isn't the only baker relying on a classic.' 

95
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,040
I'm making hazelnut and chocolate brownies, 

96
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,880
something that I make often at home. 

97
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,480
I've just pimped them up a little bit, so I've added the cherries. 

98
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,400
'Beca attempted to develop her signature brownie recipe with 

99
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,480
'the help of her husband's army regiment.' 

100
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,840
It was a toss-up between what flavours 

101
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,880
I was going to put in my brownies this week, so I did a batch 

102
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,360
of pear and walnut and chocolate, and then these, and I gave them 

103
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,560
to Matt. He took the brownies into barracks 

104
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,560
and apparently, he's still having e-mails and text messages 

105
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,280
from people saying that they like 

106
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,840
both of them, so that wouldn't have helped me in any way, bless them. 

107
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,400
I'm playing with my food, ultimately. 

108
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,960
I know you're told not to, but I like to have a bit of fun. 

109
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,240
'Frances has had another one of her ideas.' 

110
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm making my millionaire's banoffee bonus, 

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,880
so it's millionaire's shortbread crossed with a banoffee pie. 

112
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,920
'As well as blending two classic recipes, 

113
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,360
'Frances is also planning to cut her tray bake into blocks 

114
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,480
'and stack them up so that they're ready for a game.' 

115
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,120
You're wonderful at design, 

116
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,160
but sometimes, things haven't been tasting quite good enough. 

117
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,320
The originality of this is of course 

118
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,440
putting a banana in the toffee part, 

119
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,960
and that's going to be quite difficult 

120
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,240
to get it to set firm enough to cut. 

121
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,080
Yeah, you do need to cook it for quite a while 

122
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,440
to reach that fudgy consistency. 

123
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,320
Will we actually be able to play it, Frances? That'd be good. 

124
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,720
Practically. Or more just eat it, I think, really. 

125
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,680
'Three bakers are hoping to lay claim to yet another classic.' 

126
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,960
I'm making a blackberry Bakewell tart, basically. 

127
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,120
When it's cut, you should be able to see four distinct layers, 

128
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,800
the base, the jam, the frangipane and the almond topping. 

129
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,960
So it's an almond sponge in the bottom, and then it has a mixture of 

130
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,880
three berries, which is blueberries, raspberries and blackberries. 

131
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,680
'Christine's three berry Bakewell will be decorated with 

132
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,840
'glazed fresh berries and almonds, 

133
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,920
'sitting on a golden crumble topping.' 

134
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,400
My mother, bless her, always used to put a bit of water in her crumble 

135
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,400
to get more sort of lumps, but it's never worked for me. 

136
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,000
Sort of a cross between pastry and crumble, then, 

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,680
but she used to do it successfully. 

138
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,760
I'm going to be pushed for time and this pastry needs to stay cool. 

139
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,240
I've never done tray bake. I don't really do biscuits, 

140
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,520
so this week is going to be difficult. 

141
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,600
'Ruby's the only baker risking a pastry base for her 

142
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,720
'blackberry Bakewell tray bake.' 

143
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,120
So, tell us about the layers in your Bakewell. 

144
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,840
So, it's just got a sweet shortcrust pastry for the base 

145
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,480
and then I've made a blackberry jam, 

146
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,000
and the frangipane is flavoured with ginger and lemon as well. 

147
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,160
And the top? 

148
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,440
- Um...that.
- Don't tell me you're going to wing it! 

149
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,960
Well, I meant to practise, but I had my exams. 

150
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,280
I've just finished my exams. 

151
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,720
- MEL: Congratulations! 
- How did they go? 

152
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,920
They were OK, I've given it some. 

153
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,080
What's more stressful, Ruby? This or the exams? 

154
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,840
Oh, this is more stressful, exams are a breeze compared to this. 

155
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,160
Just so we know! 

156
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,520
How was your week? 

157
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,240
Apparently, being Star Baker doesn't confer a free upgrade 

158
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,520
- on the train home.
- What?! 

159
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,120
Did you sort of rock that in the train carriage, 

160
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,080
you sat in First Class and went, 

161
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,480
"I think you'll find my face is my ticket - Star Baker," 

162
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,320
and they went, "Yeah, that'll be 47 quid." 

163
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,960
'Kimberley's Bakewell features a soft biscuit base, 

164
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,480
'Florentine topping and contains five different types of cherry.' 

165
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,160
This is for the topping. I've got dried sour cherries in there, 

166
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,880
some maraschino cherries for colour, 

167
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,960
and I've also got some normal glace cherries. 

168
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,520
And then inside I'm going to be using black cherries 

169
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,840
and damsons, because they have a really good, 

170
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,080
fruity, berry flavour. 

171
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,160
With the tray bake, the point of them, really, 

172
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,560
is just a kind of simple bake, everyday, 

173
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,760
so it shouldn't be too complicated, 

174
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,200
unless you're in a baking competition. 

175
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,360
In which case, you use five different types of cherry! 

176
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,080
Mascarpone, double cream. 

177
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,920
'Rob is also adapting a classic.' 

178
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,120
Vanilla bean paste. 

179
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,960
'But it's not British.' 

180
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,320
Today's tray bake is based on a Tarta de Santiago, which is 

181
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,240
a Spanish classic frangipane cake. 

182
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,920
Normally, it's flavoured with lemon. I'm flavouring it with orange 

183
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,280
and I'm adding blueberries to it, to give it a fruity edge. 

184
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,040
'Rob's Spanish-style tray bake will be decorated with 

185
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,520
'swirls of piped mascarpone cream, flavoured with a whisky liqueur.' 

186
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,080
I used to live and work in Spain for a couple of years. 

187
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,440
That's where I met my wife, 

188
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,440
and Tarta de Santiago is absolutely divine. 

189
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,960
I've had two bad signature bakes, so I've got to get better than that. 

190
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,440
It's been tested on people. They've all said they like it, 

191
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,040
so unless they've been lying to me 

192
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,000
or I mess it up, it should be all right, I'm confident. 

193
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,120
'Most of the bakers are making their tray bake from one single mix.' 

194
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,280
God, it's a workout! 

195
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,840
'Or building up different layers of ingredients in the tin 

196
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,000
'before baking.' 

197
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,320
The crumble will fill in the gaps. 

198
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,920
You're not expecting communication, are you? 

199
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,600
Because you aren't going to get any. 

200
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,400
'But Glenn needs to find time to make three separate layers.' 

201
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,200
Pistachio digestives, 

202
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,800
marshmallow and apricots, glued together with dark chocolate. 

203
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,680
'And then assemble them afterwards.' 

204
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,480
I'm making marshmallow, which takes six hours. 

205
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,160
Six hours, and yet this is a two-hour bake. 

206
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,840
You're beginning to see the problem with my plan. 

207
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,800
I'm going to be whacking it in the freezer and praying, that's my plan. 

208
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,920
Right, that's got an hour to get cold. Now, biscuits. 

209
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,160
'Glenn is making an apricot and pistachio tiffin, 

210
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,360
'but he hasn't had much time to practise.' 

211
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,240
If you'd had the week I've had at school, 

212
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
you'd know why I haven't practised anything. 

213
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,400
I've marked 50 essays, 120 speaking and listening assessments. 

214
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,560
- For that same reason, preparation is key.
- Aww, Glenn! 

215
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,320
It's a juggling act. 

216
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,120
Now, I noticed over there, you have a bit of chocolate, 

217
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,000
well, I say a bit of chocolate - a mountain of chocolate. 

218
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,040
- How big's your tray? 
- It's actually only that big. 

219
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,000
Is that it? Well, that alone would fill that. 

220
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,880
It would, I might have got my quantities a little wrong. 

221
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,760
I'm trying to scale down and I think I've managed 

222
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,680
with my biscuits and marshmallows, 

223
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,520
- but somewhere... 
- What happened, Glenn? 

224
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,000
As long as they're neat, tidy, equal, concise, 

225
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,400
of a good size and you're not wasting too much, 

226
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,520
you'll be all right. 

227
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,360
- Not wasting too much?
- Yeah. 

228
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,440
Bakers, that's an hour gone, an hour to go, 

229
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,680
meaning essentially, you're halfway through the tray bake challenge. 

230
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,920
Doesn't matter how simple the recipe... 

231
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,480
With all the excitement going on, 

232
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,680
I forgot to put the chopped nuts in. 

233
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,000
It might be easier to just scrape it into a bowl, re-line the tin, 

234
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,400
mix it and put it back. 

235
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,560
I literally just want to shove the whole spoon in my mouth. 

236
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,880
If I was home, I probably would! 

237
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,840
GLENN COUGHS 

238
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,720
Yay, I'm so pleased! 

239
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,680
The freezer technique - so far, so good. 

240
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,280
The slight note of surprise in my voice is probably detectable, 

241
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,520
given that it didn't quite work so well at home. 

242
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,360
I've got 45 minutes left. This is a wing and a prayer. 

243
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,480
'Glenn and Frances need to factor in enough time 

244
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,920
'for their tray bakes to set in the fridge.' 

245
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,400
She looks nice, is it a she? It's a she, isn't it? 

246
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,120
They're always shes. 

247
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,680
'Everyone else...' 

248
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,880
My goal was quarter past and it's quarter past. 

249
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,200
'..begins the countdown by the oven.' 

250
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,400
43 minutes left. 

251
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,880
When you think of tray bakes, 

252
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,640
you might well think of the WI, school fetes, or the Brownies. 

253
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,320
I doubt very much 

254
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,080
if you'd think of a North London Premiership football club. 

255
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,200
'Believe it or not, the official name of this unmistakable 

256
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,080
'pink tray bake is Tottenham cake. 

257
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,360
'However, it owes its existence not to football, 

258
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,040
'but to the Quakers, a Christian group who broke 

259
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,040
'away from the established church in the 1650s.' 

260
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,480
The persecution of Quakers was rife 

261
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,520
throughout the 17th century and beyond. 

262
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,720
They believed everybody's life on a daily basis was far more 

263
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,280
important than adherence to ritual or dogma. 

264
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,000
They decided to move to more rural areas like Tottenham, away 

265
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,040
from the distractions of the city, but also pressures from other groups 

266
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,760
where they conduct their business and build their meeting houses. 

267
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,720
'One Quaker businessman who thrived during the 19th century 

268
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,080
'was the baker, Thomas Chalkley. 

269
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,640
'He's believed to have first made Tottenham cake 

270
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,640
'as an affordable treat for children, 

271
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,160
'who could buy a square for a penny and off-cuts for half the price.' 

272
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,360
Tottenham cake embraces the ideals of the Quakers. 

273
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,040
They believed in peace and living a frugal life 

274
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,880
without unnecessary luxuries, 

275
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,000
and they also believe in treating everybody equally. 

276
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,080
Friends would often bake for each other 

277
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,600
and the cakes would be distributed at meetings. 

278
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,240
Tottenham cake is still made by Quakers using local ingredients 

279
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,760
and distributed at the meeting houses. 

280
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,480
I've made Tottenham cake for perhaps 50 years. 

281
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,560
The Tottenham cake is a very convenient cake. 

282
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,680
It ties in very much with the Quaker ideas of simplicity and equality, 

283
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,920
because it can be easily cut up and distributed 

284
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,840
to a large number of people. 

285
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,200
The distinctive pink icing is traditionally made from a fruit 

286
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,360
that grows in the garden of the Tottenham Quaker House. 

287
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,720
Because we have this lovely mulberry tree in the Quaker garden, 

288
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,920
we always had pink icing. 

289
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,200
The Tottenham cake is very popular, everybody likes it. 

290
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,640
We have to be sure that everybody gets a bit. 

291
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,760
Over the last century, Tottenham cake has grown in popularity 

292
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,320
beyond just the Quakers and their meeting houses. 

293
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,240
On the 27th April, 1901, a tense FA Cup final replay ended 

294
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,320
with Tottenham Hotspur Football Club beating Sheffield United 3-1 

295
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,320
to become the only non-League side ever to win the title. 

296
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,160
To celebrate this momentous victory, 

297
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,280
local bakers made huge trays of Tottenham cake, 

298
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,000
handing them out to children. 

299
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,200
And, to this day, Tottenham cake is still made in local bakeries, 

300
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,600
all round North London and served at White Hart Lane for special events. 

301
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,520
That's all good. 

302
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,720
Bakers, you've got 30 minutes left of tray bake madness, 

303
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,960
30 minutes to go. 

304
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,840
Still quite soggy. 

305
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,880
It's so difficult because it needs to be gooey in the middle, 

306
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,400
but obviously needs to be cooked. 

307
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,360
OK, it's a little bit uneven, 

308
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,320
but, oh, well, we are where we are. 

309
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,360
It is quite a simple bake. 

310
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,400
I was thinking, you know, 

311
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,040
from a signature point of view, it is very me, 

312
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,680
but it's also, I suppose, me in that I'm trying to do 

313
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,640
a bit of a play on words, in that it's a breakfast tray bake 

314
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,320
and I'm going to be displaying it on a breakfast tray. 

315
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,920
I'm going to attempt... 

316
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,480
SHE CHUCKLES 

317
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,200
..getting this out of the tin. 

318
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,000
Mary and Paul will expect each slice of tray bake to be identical. 

319
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,640
180. 

320
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,000
HE SIGHS 

321
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,720
Why don't I teach maths? 

322
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,000
18 by three? 

323
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,160
It's going to be difficult to get that exactly right. 

324
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,040
Howard, are yours four centimetre squares? 

325
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,360
Oh, gosh, I've done it by eye, I don't know! 

326
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,880
Bakers, I hope you haven't bitten off "bourbon" you can chew. 

327
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,280
It's four minutes left. 

328
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,440
Gold leaf is very flimsy, it just seems to disappear. 

329
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,160
SHE SNORTS 

330
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,800
A bit like money. 

331
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,560
You go for it. 

332
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,040
Just drizzle the living heck out of it. 

333
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,560
Bakers, that's two minutes. 

334
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,280
You're on a two minute tray bake warning. 

335
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,840
- Stop!
- I can't. 

336
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,480
It's just a blackberry! It's just a blackberry. 

337
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,720
They're looking slightly scruffier than they did at home. 

338
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,200
OK, bakers, 30 seconds. 

339
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,640
OK, bakers, it's been a rocky road, but it's over, 

340
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,720
so please step away from the tray bakes, the bake is up. 

341
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,040
- MARY:
- Every piece is even, 

342
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,800
nice straight sides... 

343
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,800
Yum! 

344
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,160
This is the longest I've ever heard Paul be quiet for. 

345
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,480
I know, it's worrying me! 

346
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,040
I think you have an issue with the middle line of three 

347
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,720
which aren't quite baked enough, 

348
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,600
but the overall look, as a tray bake and the criteria that we gave you, 

349
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,000
- is very good.
- Thank you. 

350
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,000
I think, overall, it looks quite attractive. 

351
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,720
The flavours are lovely. 

352
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,160
The textures are nice, as well. 

353
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,440
Go on, Jenga this. 

354
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,040
I'm going to take this one away. 

355
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,800
- There you go.
- Oh, well done. 

356
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,320
It's good, it's got a nice colour underneath. 

357
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,000
I was really worried about the toffee bit not setting, 

358
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,080
because you'd put in banana, and you've been able to cut through it. 

359
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,760
Obviously... Oh! Hello! 

360
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,400
I think the flavour of the biscuit's good, 

361
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,480
the chocolate on the top and that little bit of salt in there, as well. 

362
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,040
I think this time, not only have you got the design right, 

363
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,120
you've got the actual bake right, too, for me. 

364
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,560
It's far too thick. 

365
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,280
I mean, they look, I mean... 

366
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,880
grotesque. I think they're just too big. 

367
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,920
- Grotesque?!
- Grotesque is harsh! 

368
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,600
It tastes very good. You've shown us all sorts of skills. 

369
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,120
The apricots, the pistachio, the chocolate taste absolutely lovely. 

370
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,360
Thank you. 

371
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,720
I agree with Mary totally. 

372
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,960
The textures in there are particularly good. 

373
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,600
Your marshmallow's fantastic. 

374
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,400
I'm a fan of the grotesque, bring it on. 

375
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,280
So, what has happened to that yoghurt icing? 

376
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,240
You've lost a bit of the definition because it was still warm. 

377
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,440
It's strong grapefruit flavour. 

378
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,200
I like it because it's not too sweet. 

379
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,880
Very stodgy. 

380
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,680
- It's too thick.
- Right. 

381
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,160
Because of the density and the texture you're going for, 

382
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,200
if you'd actually made it thinner, it would have been better. 

383
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,520
It's under-baked. 

384
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,760
OK. 

385
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,080
It's quite raw inside. 

386
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,160
You can tell by the colour as soon as you see it, 

387
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,160
- that's not the colour it should be. 
- Right. 

388
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,200
It's got a lovely topping on it, lots of fruit in there, 

389
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,600
but the actual mixture is just soggy. 

390
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,000
- OK.
- Thanks, Rob. 

391
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,800
I'd like to apologise for my blackberry Bakewell. 

392
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,040
It's messy and it's under-baked. 

393
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,960
The pastry's awful, as well, I can tell you that now. 

394
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,880
Great! I can't wait to tuck in! 

395
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,320
OK, you have got a bit of a soggy bottom there. 

396
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,400
I think the flavour's excellent. 

397
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,200
But the textures are all wrong. 

398
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,080
Bake's very good, it's got a nice, strong colour underneath it, as well. 

399
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,480
It's nice to see those layers, it looks very tempting. 

400
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,800
I really like it, because the texture of the Florentine's excellent. 

401
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,880
It's got a good chew to it when you bite through, 

402
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,040
and they're all equal, they look very pretty. 

403
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,840
It's been well thought out, well done. 

404
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,600
- Thank you very much. 
- Congratulations. 

405
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,240
You can keep that smile. 

406
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,440
'I feel like I can always do a little bit better.' 

407
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,480
The Japanese have a word for it. 

408
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,200
The Japanese call it "kaizen", 

409
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,360
which is constant and never-ending improvement. 

410
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,960
It's that kind of, OK, you can be happy with the way you are, 

411
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,200
but you can always do a little bit better. 

412
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,400
Relieved, I think, because I so wanted to come back this weekend 

413
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,640
showing that I can bake and do the substance with the style. 

414
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,560
I wouldn't serve something that rubbish to anyone. 

415
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,800
Not very good, is it? 

416
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
They liked the flavours, liked the idea, 

417
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,680
thought it looked a little bit sad and when they cut into it, it was. 

418
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,240
I'll still eat it. 

419
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,920
They don't know it yet, 

420
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,680
but the bakers are about to face the most delicate Technical Challenge... 

421
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,680
I'm already cream-crackered. 

422
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,840
..Mary has ever devised. 

423
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,000
Hello, bakers. It's crunch time, in more ways than one. 

424
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,320
It's your Technical Challenge. 

425
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,840
Now, Mary, it's one of your recipes. 

426
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,360
I know you're very fond of it, 

427
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,000
but we are going to ask you, please, to leave the tent. 

428
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,760
Paul, your salsa class starts in about two minutes, so off you go. 

429
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,040
(The shirt.) 

430
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,760
So, today, what we're asking you to make is a French classic. 

431
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,760
It is as French as striking, smoking and shrugging. 

432
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,480
We would like you to make 18 tuiles. 

433
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,720
Tuiles! 

434
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,800
And we'd like you to shape half of them in the traditional manner 

435
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,400
and then pipe some chocolate concentric circles into them, 

436
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,720
and the other half rolled up like cigars and dipped in chocolate. 

437
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,080
You've got an hour and a half to make your tuiles. 

438
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,480
Phwoah! 

439
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,960
- On your marks...
- Get set... 

440
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,480
- BOTH:
- Bake! 

441
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,960
I had a feeling it was going to be tuiles. 

442
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,640
This will be entertaining. 

443
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,880
A tuile is an incredibly thin biscuit 

444
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,160
that is named after the French roof tile it is said to resemble. 

445
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,680
I've never made tuiles. 

446
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,560
I am going to follow the instructions and just pray. 

447
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,040
La, la-la, la-la... 

448
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,560
I have made a tuile, and I certainly haven't piped 

449
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,200
any concentric anything on to my tuile, just made a tuile. 

450
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,880
So, I'm not going completely clueless, 

451
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,720
but about 80% clueless, I'd say. 

452
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,600
I did these, like, once, 

453
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,280
and they came out horrible, 

454
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,880
so it really doesn't give me any confidence at all. 

455
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,360
I feel OK, I made some last week, so... 

456
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,800
This really is an exceedingly difficult challenge. 

457
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,600
We're checking their piping skills, 

458
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,840
we're checking their time management and their precision. 

459
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,560
These ones here, they'll be putting on a rolling pin, 

460
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,880
and these will go around a spoon handle. 

461
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,360
CRUNCHING: Mmm. 

462
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,920
I can hear that crunch from here - that is what it's all about. 

463
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,840
The baking is tricky. 

464
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,040
If they don't keep it in long enough, 

465
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,120
when they take it out, it won't snap. 

466
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,360
If it's in too long, they won't be able to roll it up. 

467
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,720
They've got to be ready, finished, in one and a half hours. 

468
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,960
It's tricky. 

469
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,200
Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar. 

470
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,200
Mary's tuile batter is a mix of icing sugar, butter, 

471
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,560
egg white and vanilla essence. 

472
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,040
Need to beat this in. 

473
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,920
If it is overbeaten, the tuiles could shrink in the oven... 

474
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,240
Nothing a bit of elbow work won't fix. 

475
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,480
..ruining its shape. 

476
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,120
You don't need an awful lot of mixing because you don't want 

477
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,400
tonnes of air in them, they've got to be quite flat. 

478
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,040
That's probably about the consistency I would expect. 

479
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,400
It's sort of batter-y, but a little bit thicker than a pancake batter. 

480
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,640
Transfer one sixth of the mixture into a small bowl and add the cocoa. 

481
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,320
To weigh, or not to weigh. 

482
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,280
The bakers make their chocolate piping mix... 

483
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,880
Mmm. 

484
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,400
..by mixing cocoa with a portion of the batter. 

485
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,280
So, that weighs 360 divided by six... 

486
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,680
60. Six sixes are 36. 60. 

487
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,600
Both batters then need to be left long enough to set. 

488
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,160
Leave to rest. How long? 

489
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,520
When I've made Madeleine batter at home, 

490
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,680
it says to leave it for about 20 minutes, 

491
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,280
but we don't have that time. 

492
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,960
I mean, what? 

493
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,520
Just no idea. 

494
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,680
The only help Mary has provided is in the shape of a template. 

495
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,520
I think it really needs to be quite thin. 

496
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,120
It's getting them thin enough 

497
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,920
without being too thin. 

498
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,520
Because if they're too thick you won't be able to bend them, 

499
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,960
they'll just break. 

500
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,000
There's a real knack to it, a knack which I... 

501
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,480
..do not have. 

502
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,160
These aren't tuiles, these are paper. 

503
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,320
That's definitely not thick enough. 

504
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,760
I don't know if they're the right thickness. 

505
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,600
Je ne sais quoi. 

506
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,600
Three concentric circles on to that... 

507
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,160
To add the chocolate circles to the tuiles, 

508
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,360
Mary hasn't supplied a piping bag. 

509
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,160
Or any instructions on how to make one. 

510
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,200
I remember watching it a long time ago, 

511
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,400
and then thinking there's no need to bother 

512
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,760
because I could just buy a piping bag. 

513
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,040
No need to shake, it's all good. 

514
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,680
There are going to be grandmothers up and down the country 

515
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,280
being like, "She can't even make a piping bag?" 

516
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,160
You're doing a philosophy degree, and a piping bag fails you. 

517
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,280
You've studied Wittgenstein. 

518
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,480
Oh, that's... That's nothing compared to this. 

519
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,440
I will not be defeated by a sodding French biscuit. 

520
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,160
It's not until you pipe you realise... 

521
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,760
..how... 

522
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,440
..nervous you are. 

523
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,520
They certainly look it, my love. Are you OK? 

524
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,320
Little bit dissatisfied with the size of this nozzle, 

525
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,000
but I don't really... 

526
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,480
have an enormous amount of time to worry about it. 

527
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,640
- So, you've just got to crack on. 
- Yeah.
- Well done. 

528
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,840
The recipe only states the temperature 

529
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,360
at which the tuiles should be baked. 

530
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,400
Right, I have no idea how long these are going to take. 

531
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,360
Three minutes, and I'm going to sit and be patient. 

532
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,520
I'm going to see how long Beca's take to cook. 

533
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,960
Same oven settings, it's all right. 

534
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,520
Mary will expect a uniform colour... 

535
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,080
Hmm, not quite done. 

536
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,280
..and identical shape. 

537
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,520
One biscuit is melding beautifully into another. 

538
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,680
- Oh, hang on, yeah, one's having a love affair with another.
- Yeah. 

539
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,720
- There's a bit of three-way going on, actually.
- Oh, Jesus wept. 

540
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,800
There's actually a bit of five-way - one, two, three, four, five. 

541
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,040
Seven and a half minutes that'll be, yeah. 

542
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,040
I rather think they're OK. 

543
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,680
I think those look good, Frances. 

544
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,440
You're all right, my love, you're fine. 

545
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,200
I know they're meant to be thin, 

546
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,480
but there's thin, and there's... 

547
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,960
very thin. 

548
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,280
If the tuiles are allowed to cool, they'll be impossible to shape. 

549
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,960
They dry really quickly when they come out of the oven, ah! 

550
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,760
I should have brought them out a little bit earlier, 

551
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,640
because that one is now solid. 

552
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,160
They're really delicate. 

553
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,120
Are you worried about the cracking? 

554
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,560
They're cooking at different speeds. 

555
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,240
Ooh, that's broken. 

556
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,440
Oh, gosh, this is really hard. 

557
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,120
This is really hard. 

558
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,880
You've got nine? Two, four... 

559
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,320
Yes, you've got nine, brilliant. 

560
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,080
And you've got some more in the oven? 

561
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,440
- No, not yet!
- OK. 

562
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,800
- Don't make me panic!
- Sorry. Sorry. 

563
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,240
OK, bakers, 30 minutes left before you get to play tuiles of fortune. 

564
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,480
This Technical Challenge now gets even harder. 

565
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,760
OK, now for the bit that hurts. 

566
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,040
If they don't attempt to roll their cigar tuiles 

567
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,360
straight from the oven... 

568
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,440
Ow! Ah! 

569
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,520
HE LAUGHS 

570
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,880
That is painfully hot! 

571
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,600
..the delicate biscuits are even more prone to cracking 

572
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,440
and disintegrating. 

573
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,000
I'll go that way. Oh, no, crackage! 

574
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,880
I've got quite good asbestos hands anyway. 

575
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,800
Build up your tolerance over the years. 

576
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,480
I look like a right nutter here, don't I? 

577
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,640
Oh, no, they're breaking. 

578
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,000
Some of these are a bit more like fag butts than cigars. 

579
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,960
(Do these look good, Howard?) 

580
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,240
That one's not. That's pretty rubbish. 

581
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,720
I'm going to go for another batch of cigars. 

582
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,880
I think those are OK, but what do I know? 

583
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,320
Don't trust me, necessarily. 

584
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,120
OK, bakers, that's five minutes. 

585
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,840
Hope your biscuits are good, else we'll put them in the tuiley-bin. 

586
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,400
Ah! 

587
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,920
Ow! 

588
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,800
Has this gone according to plan? 

589
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,040
Right, let's dip. 

590
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,280
I think that one could do with another minute in the oven. 

591
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,200
- You've got a minute. 
- Yeah, I have. 

592
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,640
Oh, look at those! 

593
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,720
Bakers, that's it. The challenge is now over. 

594
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,640
If you'd like to bring your tuiley-wheely-wheely-wheelery and 

595
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,640
put it round by the photo of yourselves, 

596
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,200
then the judging shall commence. 

597
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,200
Mary and Paul will be looking for crisp, golden tuiles... 

598
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,360
Can I put it behind someone else's photo? 

599
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,160
..that are uniformed, and beautifully curved. 

600
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,120
You should be proud of that lot. 

601
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,440
And they'll have no idea whose tuiles are whose. 

602
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,000
Right, shall we start here, Mary? 

603
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,840
The colour's good, they look evenly baked. 

604
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,880
Pattern is quite neat as well. 

605
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,200
Just a little bit too thick. 

606
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,480
These are well rolled, a tricky business. 

607
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,160
They're better. 

608
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,520
OK, we move on to the next one. Well, these are burnt. 

609
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,560
Both of them. 

610
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,280
We certainly get the snap, 

611
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,640
but the colour is just a little bit too dark. 

612
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,400
- They look a nice, even bake. 
- They look quite thin. 

613
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,800
That's a good snap. 

614
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,240
Tastes OK. And the colour's all right. 

615
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,600
These look good. They're a nice colour round the outside. 

616
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,720
Good pattern. Shame about the bend in there, though. 

617
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,560
Nice flavour. 

618
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,800
Moving onto the next one. 

619
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,320
Bend or snap, Mary? Bend. 

620
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,480
That's a shame, they look quite good, these ones. 

621
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,360
- Colour's good.
- It's just a matter of a moment more. 

622
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,880
The cigars there are OK, cos they're nice and crispy. 

623
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,080
It's a good colour, nice bit of chocolate on the end, 

624
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,360
but unfortunately, the tuiles themselves are too thick. 

625
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,520
They're quite pale, these, aren't they? 

626
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,440
These cigars are under baked, 

627
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,520
and they've had difficulty in rolling them. 

628
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,120
Usually that is because they've been left 

629
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,200
without rolling them straight away. 

630
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,120
These are a bit of a mess, actually. 

631
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,920
It's broken in a lot of different places. 

632
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,560
Must have been quite a delicate batter. Good colour. 

633
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,960
- And these are a little bit short. 
- Yeah. 

634
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,800
And lastly... 

635
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,000
These look quite pale and thick. 

636
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,120
There you go. There's one. 

637
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,520
There's two. 

638
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,040
The tuiles will now be ranked from worst to best. 

639
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,080
In eighth place is this one. Whose is this? 

640
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,280
I think you know what went wrong, Howard. 

641
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,040
It's too thick, and wasn't baked long enough. 

642
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,680
It was basically the colour as well. 

643
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,360
Seventh place. 

644
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,080
Overbaking. 

645
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,600
Sixth place is this one. The pattern was there, 

646
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,360
and actually, you got one of the best snaps in there, 

647
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,160
but the whole thing was too thin. 

648
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:13,960
Beca is fifth, Rob is fourth, and Frances secures third. 

649
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,760
Number two is this one. 

650
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,960
Not bad at all. 

651
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,760
The pattern on this was very good. Very neat, very precise cigars. 

652
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,000
Good amount of chocolate on the end and good colour. 

653
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,840
And in first place... 

654
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,640
Christine, you got the crispest lot. 

655
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:33,560
Lovely, even pattern, and these are perfect too. 

656
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,120
Well done, Christine. 

657
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,960
I'm feeling ecstatic! 

658
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,800
Really, really thrilled! 

659
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,400
First place. Can't be better than that, can it? 

660
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,720
I came second, absolutely gobsmacking. 

661
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,440
Who knew how that happened? 

662
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,760
I knew today that in terms of ranking, 

663
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,000
I was probably the bottom one. It just... 

664
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,080
To me, it just shone out. 

665
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,400
I've learnt something today that I didn't know before 

666
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,000
about how a tuile should be. 

667
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,720
That's useful. 

668
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,920
One challenge remaining. 

669
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,360
There's a lot of jangly nerves out there, Mary. 

670
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,520
It's up and down. You just think that somebody's coming through 

671
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,960
really well, and next week they don't do as well. 

672
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,600
The good ones have all reversed. 

673
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,640
For instance you've got Howard, Kimberley, Ruby, Beca 

674
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,160
all at the bottom four of the Technical, that's unusual. 

675
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,360
Frances, she's worked hard, hasn't she? 

676
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,600
She nailed it with the millionaire's shortbread. 

677
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,280
The decoration was good, but more importantly, the flavours 

678
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,280
were good and textures were there, and then she was third on technical, 

679
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,400
and I think she's in line for Star Baker. 

680
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,000
That would make her so delighted, 

681
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,480
because she's so suffered under the yoke of someone 

682
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,800
who can make things look good, but don't taste OK. 

683
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,080
Christine came top in the technical, Mary. 

684
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,600
She did, and she had the almond tray bake, 

685
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,680
and that had very good flavours. 

686
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,400
So going into the Showstopper round, 

687
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,320
who do you think is in trouble? 

688
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,000
Howard is having a tricky time. His tray bake, far too simple, 

689
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,160
because we're looking for technique and skills. 

690
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,360
Ruby's been an interesting one this week, 

691
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,800
because she started off Bake Off feeling very insecure, 

692
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,280
and seemed to manage and master her stress levels, 

693
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,720
and this week she's back again. 

694
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,320
She's a talent. I think she's had a busy week. She's had exams 

695
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,120
and stuff this week. She's taken her eye slightly off the ball. 

696
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,120
Rob is somebody who's presented early doors 

697
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,400
as somebody who's got a lot of technical know-how. 

698
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,360
I was expecting him to rise all the way, 

699
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,280
and he's sort of kept at one level. 

700
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,280
He's got it, but he's not using it. 

701
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,240
With this lot of bakers, it seems that we never really know. 

702
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,480
We're going in slightly into the unknown. 

703
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,600
- I'm hoping they're going to make biscuits.
- Hope so. 

704
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,320
Morning, bakers, and welcome to today's Showstopper challenge. 

705
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,440
We'd like you to make a biscuit tower. 

706
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,160
It should be at least 30cm high. 

707
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,640
You can have multiple layers of biscuits, 

708
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,360
they can be any size you want, 

709
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,880
but they should all be decorated absolutely beautifully. 

710
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,680
You've got four hours on biscuit tower challenge. 

711
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,120
- On your marks...
- Get set... 
- Bake! 

712
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,200
For the first time this year, the bakers have a chance 

713
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,440
to impress not just with their baking, 

714
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,480
but also with their construction. 

715
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,760
To create this tower, it's not only got to taste good 

716
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,760
and look good, but structurally, it's got to be sound. 

717
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,480
You've not only got to be a baker, but you have to be an architect too. 

718
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,400
I want something that when we actually taste it, 

719
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,560
those biscuits snap, have different flavours, different finishes, 

720
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,720
different icings, good to eat, and good to look at. 

721
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,280
The texture of the biscuits is crucial 

722
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,080
to the stability of the towers. 

723
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,360
If they don't work the dough enough, the biscuit may be short, crumbly 

724
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,360
and too weak to support any weight. 

725
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,480
My biscuits are really, really delicate. 

726
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,520
They're Viennese whirls, so they've got a really high fat content 

727
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,400
which makes them very short and crumbly. 

728
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,000
Kimberley's rather brave choice of Viennese biscuits 

729
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,120
will be stacked in the style of a wedding cake 

730
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,480
and piped with a caramel buttercream icing. 

731
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,840
- How many layers will there be? 
- 16. 

732
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,240
Gosh, that's a lot of piping! 

733
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,600
It's a lot of piping, it's a lot of biscuits. 

734
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,160
The bottom ones are going to be taking some weight. 

735
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,800
You've had any problems with it crumbling or breaking off? 

736
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,800
I haven't, actually. I've been quite lucky. 

737
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,160
If I can get the bottom ones frozen 

738
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,840
before I put them into the tower, actually, they're quite stable. 

739
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,120
The tea in a tea bag tends to be finer than ordinary leaf teas. 

740
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,760
It's quite common to use green tea powder within cooking, 

741
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,240
but actually, using other forms of other leaf tea, I think, 

742
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,280
is a bit unusual. 

743
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,920
Howard's making four different tea-flavoured biscuits 

744
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,960
and shaping them to form a Japanese pagoda. 

745
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,120
When I've done this previously, people were quite impressed. Yeah. 

746
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,480
It's like, "Wow!" 

747
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,640
That was my mum and dad, though. 

748
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,560
My biscuit flavours are all shortbread. Four flavours, 

749
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,600
orange and cardamom, lemon and lavender, chocolate and vanilla. 

750
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,400
Christine will be stacking her biscuits in the shape 

751
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
of a Bavarian clock tower. 

752
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,800
The shortbreads have all got to be the same size, 

753
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,560
because it's no good having a thick one and a thin one, 

754
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,960
I won't be able to build it. 

755
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,920
And I'm making 70, and they've all got to be the same. 

756
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,480
To ensure a safe and stable structure, 

757
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,000
consistency of the biscuits is crucial, or the towers could topple. 

758
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,080
I've got a little mark here, for 3mm, and I'm measuring my biscuits. 

759
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,320
When I did them at home, some of them were like breeze blocks 

760
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,360
and some of them were like crackers, so I might as well just... 

761
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,320
I need to be consistent, so that's why I look a bit OCD. 

762
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,280
Ruby is using ginger and cinnamon, and lemon and ginger biscuits 

763
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,200
to build a tower in the shape of a dropped ice cream. 

764
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,400
Everything hangs on today for me, 

765
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,320
so I really have to just focus and be precise, 

766
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,000
and something as simple as measuring these biscuits 

767
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,600
to make sure they're the same height, 

768
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,480
that could make the difference. 

769
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,600
This has worked beautifully in practice, 

770
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,080
and I've found that the key is 

771
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,960
to get the dough properly cold before it goes in the oven. 

772
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,720
As long as it doesn't taste like meat... 

773
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,960
I'm OK with it looking like salami. 

774
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,400
Glenn's cherry and hazelnut shortbread 

775
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,840
will be in the shape of a helter-skelter, 

776
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,720
and his structure inspired by a traditional Scandinavian cake. 

777
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,880
I'm using these, erm... 

778
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,040
Discuses? 

779
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,440
Kransekake pans, which produce a series of rings 

780
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,680
that will make the tower. 

781
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,320
I'll cover them in white chocolate, 

782
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,960
and then I'm making a raspberry macaron. 

783
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,240
You always go for, like, massive mixes. 

784
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,800
You use the biggest bowl that we've got on Bake Off. 

785
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,560
How many are you going to make from that? 

786
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,240
Well, this is in case I do need to literally make two batches, 

787
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,200
because I'm not the world's most experienced macaron maker. 

788
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,480
Right. 

789
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,040
It's very difficult to make compromises on something 

790
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,160
that's an iconic shape. 

791
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,720
Everybody knows what they look like, so if there's something missing, 

792
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,200
I can't cut my cloth like other people might be able to. 

793
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,000
Rob's Showstopper is in the shape 

794
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,800
of one of the world's most recognisable science fiction characters. 

795
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,720
It's a Dalek. 

796
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,320
- PAUL:
- Of course it is. 

797
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,720
That will obviously "exterminate" the competition. 

798
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,040
That's the E-word. We don't say that round here. 

799
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,440
- Why don't you say the E-word? 
- It brings bad luck. 

800
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,600
It is pretty much to scale. 

801
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,160
Chocolate would be this part here, lemon and orange. 

802
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,280
- Depends which bits break.
- The lemon Daleks were always my favourite. 

803
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,360
- Exactly!
- Love them. 

804
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,040
The towers require multiple batches of biscuits. 

805
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,760
10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, great. 

806
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,720
While watching to ensure they bake correctly... 

807
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,240
Both lots are going in the oven. 

808
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,920
..there are plenty of decorations to keep them busy. 

809
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:54,080
I'm making my macaroons, which are going to be sat on my structure. 

810
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,280
It's based on a cake stand, so I'm having several layers, 

811
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,240
and on different layers there'll be macaroons and sugared flowers, 

812
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,840
and I'm hopefully going to make little iced gem biscuits as well. 

813
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,560
So there'll be lots of nice, girly treats all over it. 

814
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,840
Very unlike me. 

815
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,960
I've tested it on friends 

816
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,320
and they've been very helpful taste testers. 

817
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,520
Frances aims to construct a biscuit haberdashery box, 

818
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,640
with a tower of buttons and beads. 

819
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,920
They've said I needed to put a bit more vanilla in my vanilla one. 

820
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,880
They really liked the ginger one 

821
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,240
and they liked the unusual nature of the peanut butter one. 

822
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,160
Not only do the biscuits need to be perfectly baked... 

823
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,720
Still leathery. That's way, way, way behind. 

824
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,680
..they also need to have time to cool 

825
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,640
before any construction can begin. 

826
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,320
They're not too bad. 

827
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,480
GLENN GIGGLES 

828
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,360
I would expect them to feel a little bit crisper, 

829
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:01,400
but I'm going to go with the colour and...hope. 

830
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,720
Last batch, done! 

831
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:12,520
Bakers, you've got an hour of tower left. One hour. 

832
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,360
It looks very precarious work. 

833
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:36,400
You've got some icing there. It will be glued together? 

834
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,000
Yeah. 

835
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,120
Oh, I feel sick making this! 

836
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,160
Beca, Christine and Howard are all using traditional royal icing 

837
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,080
to cement their towers together. 

838
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,280
As it gets taller, it gets more wobbly. 

839
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,600
But Rob is sticking with science. 

840
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,960
I'm gluing this together now. 

841
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,840
The sugar I'm using is a microwavable malt mix. 

842
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,640
Ow! Oh, God, that's hot. 

843
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:10,960
And this will become more sound as other things get glued to it. 

844
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,400
So this is your marker, this is how tall it's got to be? 

845
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,240
- Yeah.
- That's a lot of biscuits. 
- Then I've got beads as well. So... 

846
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,200
OK, is that going to stay? 

847
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,360
I am slightly concerned, I have to say. 

848
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,560
Let it go, let's see. Those are nice. 

849
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,680
It's all good. 

850
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,240
Erm... 

851
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,480
This is very delicate. 

852
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,560
Hurray! 

853
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,840
OK, bakers, 30 minutes until Mary and Paul... 

854
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,320
- DALEK VOICE:
- ..exterminate! 

855
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,160
Ooh, right, OK. 

856
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,600
I don't think that's going to happen. 

857
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,400
Maybe there's a little bit of action here. 

858
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,960
I need to put this buttercream on. Because it's curved, 

859
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,880
I can't really just use a palette knife, I need to use my hands. 

860
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,840
It just means I can get it in all the gaps. 

861
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,080
If you've got a problem with time, you can 

862
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,240
always go into your TARDIS and go back about four hours. 

863
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,120
If I had one of those, it'd be done by now! 

864
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,880
- They look really good. I mean, look at that!
- I
- made them. 

865
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,800
15 minutes, and check. 

866
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,440
I'm going to put some dried raspberry powder on the top. 

867
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,520
When I put freeze-dried raspberries on the tops of mine, 

868
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,800
it burnt, so what you could do is, I've got some edible glue 

869
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,920
or some egg white, and brush a little bit on once it's baked. 

870
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,520
Bakers, ten minutes on your towers. Ten minutes on your towers. 

871
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,120
Oh, ten minutes, oh, my God. 

872
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,400
Come on, push, push, push. 

873
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,080
Ooh... 

874
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,720
This is the hairy bit. 

875
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,920
Bakers, that's one minute to go, one minute to go on your towers. 

876
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah, you're OK. Ooh! 

877
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,120
Oh, no. Oh, God. 

878
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,760
OK, bakers, down tools, construction's over, 

879
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,720
put your bakes to the end of your benches and stand clear. 

880
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,000
Frances, hold it together, my love. 

881
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:05,120
No-one will notice, I'll just stand here while they're judging. Come on. 

882
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,200
I can't leave you just there. 

883
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,240
It's all right. 

884
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,720
If I leave, it won't stand up. 

885
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,720
OK... 

886
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,000
It's judgement time. 

887
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,840
Glenn, could you bring your Showstopper up, please? Thank you. 

888
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,240
It's definitely tall enough, it's colourful. Yeah. 

889
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,600
I'm quite pleased with that. 

890
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,160
- It does look quite impressive. 
- Thank you. 

891
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,760
The macarons look great. You've got a nice shine on there, 

892
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,080
bit of a foot as well. 

893
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,280
They've got a bit of chew in the middle, you've got them 

894
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,240
beautifully evenly baked, even those little ones, which is good. 

895
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,760
The shortbread's good. I like the taste of the chocolate, 

896
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,600
and the macarons are exceptional. 

897
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:07,640
Thank you. 

898
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,400
I think it's fun, it'd be great for a little girl's party. 

899
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,680
And it is quite stable, you can see that. 

900
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,800
- I don't like the flavour of the biscuit.
- No? 
- Don't like the texture either. 

901
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,920
It's not quite a cookie, it's not quite a biscuit, 

902
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,000
- because it doesn't snap.
- OK. 

903
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
But the macarons are exceptional. 

904
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,480
- You get the end.
- Ooh. 

905
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,520
Ooh. I was worried when I came round 

906
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,120
that Viennese was never going to be a carrier for a structure. 

907
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,360
And it proved the point. 

908
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,400
You've got cracks all the way down every one of those layers. 

909
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,240
You only have to rub them lightly, and it all falls apart. 

910
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,560
It needed a little bit of extra work in it. 

911
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,120
But nice to see the two different coloured layers, 

912
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,840
it gives it a very nice effect. 

913
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,320
Howard. 

914
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,440
To be perfectly honest, I have no idea what that tastes like. 

915
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,520
Fingers crossed that it's OK. 

916
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,280
It's meticulous. 

917
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,680
It's totally different. 

918
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,680
Never seen anything like it before. 

919
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,480
I think it's impressive, it is a piece of art. 

920
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,280
I love that. That's clever. 

921
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,840
Tea is quite a difficult flavour to impart into anything, 

922
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,200
but to impart it into a biscuit, 

923
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,000
I think you've done well there, Howard. 

924
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,360
The flavours are there, but I do find it quite boring to eat. 

925
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,320
But full marks for design. 

926
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,400
Nervous, I am nervous. 

927
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,520
I feel like I have, hopefully, style, but not structure! 

928
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,000
The brief for this challenge was a tower. 

929
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,840
- Now, that tower has to stay up.
- Yeah. 

930
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,080
The biscuits are beautifully baked. They're different thicknesses, 

931
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:37,320
different sizes, different finishes, but it has sadly collapsed. 

932
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,600
The flavour of the biscuits are good but it's like... 

933
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,480
- four hours, you made a load of biscuits.
- Yeah. 

934
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,600
I achieved what I wanted to do. 

935
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,960
I THINK it looks like an alpine clock tower. 

936
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,640
I think that's stunning. 

937
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,480
You have made something that you could put on a tea-party table, 

938
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,200
and everybody would have a decent piece of shortbread. 

939
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,520
It's very cute. It's a good, strong structure as well. 

940
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,080
All the flavours are all good, texture's good, 

941
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,920
the bake's good, the look of them's good. Excellent. 

942
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:32,400
I wanted a Dalek, I promised a Dalek, I've got a Dalek. 

943
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,640
Well, it definitely looks like a Dalek, as we know. 

944
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,360
It's a little bit clumsy. 

945
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,920
Are these edible? 

946
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,000
No, but there is a cocktail stick through the middle. 

947
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,960
Well, there's the edible glue. 

948
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,280
Now, that, I would not like to come across. 

949
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,480
They're OK. That's probably the best I can do on the biscuits. 

950
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,360
I think the one on the top's the nicest one, 

951
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,640
the others are bland. Some are better than others. 

952
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,760
- Right, OK.
- For the design, it's exactly what it should be. 

953
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,600
But when you actually come down to eating it, it's not such a joy. 

954
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,320
I'm so disappointed in myself because that bake had to save me, 

955
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,440
and clearly, I've messed it up completely. 

956
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,440
You almost feel you want to get hold of it 

957
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,120
and turn it upright and lick it. 

958
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,880
A lovely textured biscuit. Works very well with the white chocolate. 

959
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,800
- They tasted lovely, really good. 
- Oh, good. 

960
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:16,200
The orange comes through really well on the top, the texture of it... 

961
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,240
Is absolutely beautiful. 

962
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,240
Mmm. Great flavours, great texture. Well done. 

963
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,600
I'm shocked! 

964
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,760
- Well done, Ruby. 
- Thank you, Ruby. 

965
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,960
'Mary and Paul must now decide who will be this week's Star Baker 

966
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,360
'and who will be going home.' 

967
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,000
Where do you think people stand at the end of this challenge? 

968
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,360
Let's talk first about Glenn. 

969
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,400
His helter-skelter, well, it came together in the end, didn't it? 

970
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,800
It tasted good, it looked good. 

971
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,440
Christine has had a really cracking week, in the main. 

972
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,680
I thought she did magnificently. Not only did it look stunning - 

973
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,680
practically, there was a tea for the family. 

974
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:09,040
Now, Frances was also having a very good weekend until today. 

975
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,640
The most important thing is to produce a tower. Well, it fell. 

976
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,600
Kimberley had a slight roller coaster. 

977
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,640
Those Viennese weren't baked properly. 

978
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,520
You could rub it and it was still paste. 

979
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,240
Does that put her in the danger zone? 

980
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,360
You could throw her down there, yeah. 

981
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,960
Howard was down there as we approached this challenge. 

982
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,000
Has he done enough? 

983
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,640
I was highly impressed with this. 

984
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,440
I wasn't mad about it, but I do think the actual structure 

985
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,080
was beautiful, very well thought out. 

986
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,080
- Rob gave us a Dalek. 
- But I didn't really want to eat it. 

987
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,800
A lot of the components, you couldn't eat anyway. 

988
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,320
You ate a lot of glue, Mary. 

989
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,280
And actually, the edible glue just tastes of nothing. 

990
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,440
It was a bit scruffy, 

991
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,120
but I admire the ability of the guy to do it anyway in biscuit. 

992
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,640
I thought that Ruby today had a bit of a saviour. 

993
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,640
Has she done enough to keep herself out of the danger zone? 

994
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,400
That's for Mary and I to discuss. 

995
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,080
We'll leave you to decide. 

996
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,920
I just need to take some of these biscuits for scientific analysis. 

997
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,920
Have a dunker, mate. Have a dunker. 

998
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:23,280
Well done, bakers. I'm sure you all feel pretty exhausted. 

999
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,880
You've been stalwart and brilliant across the board, so well done. 

1000
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,760
I'm the messenger of good news. 

1001
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,240
Paul and Mary have decided who's going to be this week's Star Baker. 

1002
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,520
This baker's provided some truly wonderful stuff for us to eat 

1003
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,400
this weekend, so thank you very much. 

1004
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,480
And I would personally like to book myself in 

1005
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,880
to the Bavarian Christmas Shortbread House 

1006
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,560
for about two months. 

1007
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,960
- Christine, you are Star Baker. 
- Well done. 

1008
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,680
I get to be the bearer of bad news this week. 

1009
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,400
As you know, we do have to lose one of you... 

1010
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,240
..and the person we're saying goodbye to today is... 

1011
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,680
..Rob. 

1012
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,400
No prob. 

1013
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,440
- Oh, Rob, you will be a very sad loss.
- We'll miss you. 

1014
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,560
- Sandwich.
- Sandwich, give me that sandwich. 

1015
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:21,640
My ambitions when I came in were to win Star Baker once, 

1016
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,720
not get kicked out in the first round, 

1017
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,600
and to win one of the technicals. 

1018
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,600
I did all three of those, so that's fine, and mainly to have some fun. 

1019
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,960
We will miss you. 

1020
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,480
OK, I'll miss it too. 

1021
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,040
It is always a difficult decision who is going to leave. 

1022
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,960
Rob started off a proper scientist, very meticulous, 

1023
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,600
but that's really where he stayed. 

1024
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,000
- Dead lucky.
- I know, I know. 

1025
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,440
'I do feel that I've been saved by the Showstopper yet again.' 

1026
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,760
Oh, I just don't want to be in that position again. 

1027
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,280
- And you just pulled it out, didn't you?
- I'm so glad. 

1028
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:55,920
I'm pleased they like my bakes more than I seem to, so that's good. 

1029
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,040
I'd already booked my cab home, so... 

1030
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,200
Well done. 

1031
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,800
I think it's kind of told me that 

1032
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,640
I need to be a bit more careful and think things through really clearly. 

1033
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,800
Please, not the design. 

1034
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,560
It is emotional, really, really emotional. 

1035
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,720
I think I was dreading the moment the biscuit dropped on the floor. 

1036
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,520
I feel like I've been on Glenn's helter-skelter. 

1037
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:25,240
I'm feeling so happy, and so pleased, and surprised. 

1038
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,560
I don't really do biscuits 

1039
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:29,600
and I've had the week from hell at school, and haven't been able 

1040
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,520
to practise anything, so I'm really proud of myself. 

1041
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,240
Just so pleased I've got past the halfway point now, 

1042
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,400
and, yeah, completely over the moon, absolutely. 

1043
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,840
Halfway through, that'll do me. I can go on holiday now. 

1044
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,120
Come back for the final. 

1045
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,320
I'm going to take a few days off from baking, 

1046
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,160
I suspect that's fairly normal. 

1047
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,400
I think I'll go home and boil something. 

1048
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,600
But it won't be suet. 

1049
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,320
'Next time...' 

1050
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,080
Come on! 

1051
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,600
That's good, get out the tension. 

1052
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,600
'..the bakers must rise to the challenge of sweet dough.' 

1053
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,760
I just thought, let's use a bit of booze. 

1054
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,960
'With signature tea loaves... 

1055
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,560
It's like a little bottom. 

1056
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,000
Got to go naughty sometimes. 

1057
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,840
'..Paul's twisted technical...' 

1058
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,600
- You're very cruel.
- Oh, yes. 

1059
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,280
'..apricot couronne...' 

1060
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,680
Am I reading this right? Oh, gosh. 

1061
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,680
'..and 168...' 

1062
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,440
I've never known buns that big. 

1063
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,120
'..showstopping sweet buns.' 

1064
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,560
There's going to be no panic. 

1065
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,800
Who am I kidding? 

1066
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,640
'But whose dough will be sweetest?' 

1067
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,240
- Those are monsters. 
- How beastly are they?
- Very. 

1068
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,480
'And whose bake off...' 

1069
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,960
It's gone...plop. 

1070
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,840
'..is about to come to a bitter end?' 

1071
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,520
I might as well be doing this entire challenge like this, 

1072
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,680
because that is how much of an idea I have. 

1073
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:59,240
