1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,920
So after the shock departure last week of not one but two bakers, 

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,320
there is literally everything to play for, but how many will go this week? 

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,720
I don't know, it could be three or five, or it could even be the final. 

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,080
Who knows? When Paul and Mary get trigger-happy anyone's fair game. 

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,320
I'm going to leave before they fire me, it's the Great British Bake Off. 

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,880
- 'Last time...'
- Where's my custard? 

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,960
- '..desserts proved to be the undoing..'
- Oh, no!
- '..of Mark...' 

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,400
They're not very ball-like. 

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,040
That's a bit knitty. 

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,400
'..and Deborah...' 

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,560
Can't do this. 

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,000
- '..who both had to leave.' 
- I'll miss you, matey. 

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,760
'But Christine had her best week yet...' 

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,120
Gosh, that's scrummy. 

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,680
'..and her stunning desserts won her Star Baker.' 

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,800
APPLAUSE 

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,880
'Now the bakers face pies and tarts...' 

18
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,280
If my bottom's dry today...all will be right with the world. 

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,600
Looks all right. 

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,480
'..a Signature Challenge...' 

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,960
Shall I put my water wings on? 

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,960
'..throws them in at the deep end...' 

23
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,240
I think that brown stuff is burn. 

24
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,840
I think I might be in trouble with this one. 

25
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,480
'..a Technical from Paul that would make most people fall apart...' 

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,400
Desperate times, desperate measures. 

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,880
'..a Showstopper that stretches them to their absolute limits...' 

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,200
That is one large sort of filo snake you need to wrangle. 

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,800
- This is "Pie-thagoras", this pie. 
- Pie-thagoras! 

30
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,640
Right, what do we need to do? 

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,160
'..and a little unwanted help from their friends.' 

32
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,120
Hang on, hang on. 

33
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,120
It's not good, is it? 

34
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,440
I can't watch this. 

35
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,240
TOGETHER: # Who ate all the pies? Who ate all the pies? 

36
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,920
# Mel and Sue did, Mel and Sue did We ate all the pies. # 

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,400
It's pies and tarts week. 

38
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,480
I think I'll get me steak and kidney. 

39
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,160
Morning, bakers, and welcome to... it's a Life Of Pie, isn't it? 

40
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,400
We're going to be asking you not to sit on a boat and look after a tiger. 

41
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,960
Oh, that's a shame! Can you lose the tiger? 

42
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,040
Lose the tiger. 

43
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,600
But what we would like you to do, though, please, 

44
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,480
is a Signature Bake which is a double-crusted fruit pie, 

45
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,840
which means pastry not just on the top but on the bottom as well, 

46
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,160
and not soggy. 

47
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,320
Right, so the pastry can be a sweet or shortcrust, 

48
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,560
you can fill it with whatever fruit you like 

49
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,480
but when it's cut in two, the pastry must hold its shape. 

50
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,880
- You've got two hours, on your marks...
- Get set...
- ..bake! 

51
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,640
They walk into it, thinking, "It's only pies. 

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,840
"I can knock a couple of pies up no problem." 

53
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,880
But you've got to make a pie that's perfect. 

54
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,080
If you do not know how to make a sweet pastry and shortcrust 

55
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,880
pastry, you shouldn't be in that tent. 

56
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,000
There's so much that can go wrong. 

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,560
If fruit is overcooked in a pie, it releases too much wet. 

58
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,880
That goes down to the pastry underneath and makes it soggy. 

59
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,400
The terror of a soggy bottom has been keeping me up all night. 

60
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,600
If my bottom is dry today...all will be right with the world. 

61
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,080
Kimberley's fruit pie is a firm favourite of her boyfriend Giuseppe. 

62
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,560
Topped with rosemary caramel, 

63
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,080
her pecan filling will be surrounded by rosemary pastry. 

64
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,040
The addition of the rosemary is interesting, 

65
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,160
- it's all about the delicacy with rosemary.
- I can smell it here. 

66
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,960
That's been steeping for a couple of months. 

67
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,360
- I think it will go well.
- Thank you. 

68
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,000
It smells really delicious. 

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,080
I'm making a shortcrust pastry with some orange zest 

70
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,360
in it for added flavour. 

71
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,480
I just want to get the pastry made 

72
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,200
so it can have a chance of resting, it's so tight on times. 

73
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,680
This is the covering for my butter and I just found it in my blender. 

74
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,960
I'm sure clingfilm's edible(!) 

75
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,600
Ali loves to use ingredients from around the world, 

76
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,400
but he's never made a simple English fruit pie. 

77
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,080
He's making pecan and walnut shortcrust pastry, 

78
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,400
with an apple and ginger filling. 

79
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,200
I'm using Granny Smiths because they still retain a bit of bite 

80
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,840
but I'm not actually a big fan of fruit pie, 

81
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,520
in fact, I loathe fruit pie so I've been trying... 

82
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,280
So you've never tasted things you've made? When you've made a fruit pie, you can't eat it? 

83
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,480
I find it disgusting. 

84
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,800
- We're going to enjoy it.
- I hope Granny Smith doesn't have a damp bottom.
- Thank you. 

85
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,760
When I pulsed my fat into the flour, I got great lumps of butter in it, 

86
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,600
which I don't want for shortcrust, hence I'm starting again. 

87
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,240
The recipe for Christine's pie belonged to her grandmother, 

88
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,400
and she bakes it weekly. 

89
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,760
Her Granny Rogers' apple, plum 

90
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,160
and cinnamon country pie is also flavoured with allspice and nutmeg. 

91
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,400
I would like to get everything consistent across the board 

92
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,320
on this pie. I want the pastry to be even, I want it to be the right thickness, 

93
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,760
I want the fruit just to be done, I want everything to be right. 

94
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,280
I think I will be OK time-wise, I've just got to work a bit faster. 

95
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,520
In the food processor at the moment I've got plain flour 

96
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,360
but I've also added some polenta. 

97
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,760
It gives it slightly a grainier more biscuity texture, 

98
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,640
but it also absorbs some of the moisture which you're going to 

99
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,000
get from putting fresh herbs in it. 

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,400
Howard regularly brings his bakes into work, where they're 

101
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,960
enjoyed by his colleagues at Sheffield City Council. 

102
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,800
The apples in his pie are accompanied by sultanas, 

103
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,320
and pistachios, and surrounded by sage pastry. 

104
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,680
The pastry does look a little bit crumbly but I'm going to pop 

105
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,720
it in the fridge to rest while I'm making the filling. 

106
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,840
That smells so good. Mm, sweet buttery apple-ness, yum! 

107
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,320
Judging by the smell, there's not enough ginger in there. 

108
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,640
I'm not going to taste it because I don't want to. 

109
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,480
Today, I'm making my mamgu's cherry apple tart. 

110
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,280
It's just something that my mum's mum came up with 

111
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,120
when my brother and I refused to eat rhubarb pie. 

112
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,120
So she called it "cherry-apple tart" and we lapped it up. 

113
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,520
Beca blows off steam outside the kitchen by running three 

114
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,000
times a week. 

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,080
Her mamgu's cherry-apple pie is ensconced in a pastry 

116
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,680
flavoured with orange zest. 

117
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,120
The rhubarb is just finishing off roasting 

118
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,520
so I've had a bit of a disaster this week making some of them. 

119
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,720
My grandmothers would never bake their rhubarb first, 

120
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,320
they'd always put it in raw. 

121
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,560
Did they have soggy bottoms? 

122
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,440
Yeah, but it never did bother us. 

123
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,760
But my nan told me 

124
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,000
to put some semolina in the bottom which has worked. 

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,440
Might need to have some waterproofs on just in case. 

126
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,920
I'll bring my scuba. 

127
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,600
Rhubarb splash-back. 

128
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,560
I really like marzipan 

129
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,800
so I've desperately wanted to put it in something. 

130
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,840
I thought apple marzipan would be all right. 

131
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,160
I was really unhappy with it for a while and then one day 

132
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,800
it occurred to me, the sour cherries, 

133
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,280
and that really lifts it, I think. 

134
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,840
So I'm chuffed with that. 

135
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,760
Ruby juggles revising for her exams with devising new 

136
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,080
ways of blending flavours in her bakes. 

137
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,520
She's settled on an apple and marzipan pie, 

138
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,400
with dried sour cherries. 

139
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,040
This is just a little bit of sugar and cornflour, it helps to 

140
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,240
soak up some of the liquid they'll release when they cook. 

141
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,160
So the pie crust hopefully won't be too soggy. 

142
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,920
My fruit pie is like a mixture of peach and frangipane. 

143
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,560
I remove, obviously, the stone 

144
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,040
and then I fill that with a bit of frangipane 

145
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:47,280
and then I place in a whole almond, to sort of replicate the stone. 

146
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,760
Frances' parents ran a book shop so she grew up influenced by stories. 

147
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,040
And a classic children's tale was the inspiration for this bake, 

148
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,440
a peach pie in the sky. 

149
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,760
I was inspired by James And The Giant Peach. 

150
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,920
So you'll get a slice of peach when you get through the pie 

151
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,880
and then it's going to be shaped like a hot-air balloon. 

152
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,840
You could have made an effort(!) 

153
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,760
You've totally lost me now. 

154
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,840
Sounds like it needs planning permission, this pie. 

155
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,760
- Good luck with that one. 
- Thank you very much. 

156
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,080
I look forward to seeing the balloon. I've no idea. 

157
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,560
The key challenge with pies is ensuring that the pastry is 

158
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,080
baked through. 

159
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,080
Each baker has their own way of avoiding a soggy crust. 

160
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,360
Some more technical than others. 

161
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,120
To try and avoid a soggy bottom, you've got to get as much 

162
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,560
heat into it as you can. 

163
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:43,800
My plan is to not use a base but place that like that and then 

164
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,640
I'll slide the whole lot onto a baking tray which is already heating 

165
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,840
up in the oven, and hopefully that'll be hot enough to do the job. 

166
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,080
Bread is Rob's true baking passion, 

167
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,800
so pastry presents more of a challenge. 

168
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,720
His Signature Pie is filled with apple, pears, thyme and star anise. 

169
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,160
These time-compressed challenges, 

170
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,520
you've got to think of other ways of doing things. 

171
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,040
Moisture is the big problem for these pies. 

172
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,360
I've counteracted the liquid that comes 

173
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,480
out of the apples by putting some semolina in the bottom, 

174
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,960
I've also mixed some cornflour and some icing sugar as well. 

175
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,240
This is frangipane, but it's a slightly thicker one. 

176
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,800
It's got more flour than normal, and it helps soak up 

177
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,240
any of the juices that will come out of the peach itself. 

178
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,080
I found a recipe for sour cream and maple syrup custard. 

179
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,880
Maple syrup adds a lot to the flavour, and to the moisture which, 

180
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,520
you know, as we all know, moisture is the enemy of everything today. 

181
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,280
Glenn's been looking for inspiration for his pie in various places 

182
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,680
and his friends have been keen to help...ooh, and Molly too. 

183
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,520
He's making a sweet crust pastry to hold his apple 

184
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,280
and maple syrup custard filling. 

185
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,760
So the custard baked in it. 

186
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,720
- Like a quiche?
- A sweet quiche. 

187
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,240
It could be really absolutely lovely. 

188
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,920
You say "could". 

189
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,520
There's all sorts of things that could go wrong. 

190
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,160
Exactly, you're dealing with apples that are going to release 

191
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,040
the juice, and you have maple syrup which tends to thin out 

192
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,000
in an oven anyway, plus you have the custard going in on top of that. 

193
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,920
- Good luck.
- If it goes wrong, apple scramble, all good. 

194
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,680
'With the pastry cases and fillings made, the pies must be covered 

195
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,640
'and decorated quickly to allow enough time in the oven.' 

196
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,720
It should go down to the wire which is pretty much practice with me. 

197
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,720
Oh, I've got a bit of crackage going on there. Cracking. 

198
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,320
We're going for the Vermont, New England feel...that looks vile. 

199
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,680
That's a nasty pink colour. 

200
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,760
Oh, my God, the problem goes from one extreme to the other 

201
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,920
but I think that's nearer where I need to be. 

202
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,920
It needs to be in the oven ideally ten minutes ago. 

203
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,000
Get a move on, Ali. 

204
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,280
The monster's in. 

205
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,400
Right. 

206
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,440
OK, bakers, in 30 minutes' time, your bakes have a date 

207
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,960
with my pie hole. 

208
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,080
30 minutes. 

209
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,200
"Gas Mark 4 for 35-40 minutes." 

210
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,840
I think I know someone who's going to have a soggy bottom. 

211
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,120
I'm bending down to have a look, 

212
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,840
because I'm waiting for my pie to cook. 

213
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,240
SHE LAUGHS 

214
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,720
It looks very nice on top 

215
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,440
and I'm hoping that that's replicated underneath. 

216
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,560
Bakers, ten minutes left on the pies. Ten minutes left. 

217
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,120
I'm going up. I'm going up to 200. 

218
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,600
Going for blast furnace heat now. 

219
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,760
Now you are on circa therm intensive 230 degrees. 

220
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,360
This is basically becoming thermo-nuclear. 

221
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,600
Is that burning a bit? 

222
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,160
I think it might be. 

223
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,320
I think that brown stuff is burn. Ooh, is that some leak? 

224
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,360
I think it's just fat. 

225
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,320
I think I should take it out. 

226
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,360
Go with your instinct. 

227
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,040
I have no instinct on fruit pies. 

228
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,360
That bit might be soggy. 

229
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
You know what? It is what it is now. 

230
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,200
It looks all right. 

231
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,240
No, I'm going to leave it till the last second. 

232
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,600
One minute, just one minute to go. 

233
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,320
Not completely happy with that. 

234
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,920
- Oh, look, this is a little basket! 
- And they're the ropes. 

235
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,680
Leave it. Leave it, leave it, leave it. 

236
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,080
OK, bakers, that's it, time's up. 

237
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,600
Please put your pies at the end of your benches. 

238
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,040
Step away from the pie. 

239
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,960
I'm dying to see what the cut is going to be like. 

240
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,080
Ooh, it is soggy down there. 

241
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,440
Can't taste the custard. 

242
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,720
All it's adding is a little bit of moisture. 

243
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,240
The apples are perfectly cooked but, to be honest, 

244
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,520
the pastry could have done with another ten minutes. 

245
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,840
Didn't get it in early enough. 

246
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,560
You had plenty of time to practise and you knew how long it was going to be, you shouldn't have picked it. 

247
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,160
That's teacher, isn't it? 

248
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,800
I say things like that all the time, I have to take it. 

249
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,160
I can't see how you can get that custard perfect 

250
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,960
and get the pastry cooked as well. 

251
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,680
It's just not quite right. 

252
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,040
It just looks so inviting, it's a beautiful colour. 

253
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,680
That is, quite frankly, delicious. 

254
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,200
And one of the nicest pies I've had for some years. 

255
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,520
The pastry is crispy, it's golden, the apples are fantastic, 

256
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,360
the nuts come through very well 

257
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,880
and what stays on your tongue afterwards is that beautiful caramel flavour that coats your tongue. 

258
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,440
It is sort of toffee apple pie. 

259
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,240
Well done. I'll take this one with me, I think. 

260
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,320
The artwork that you've done is stunning. 

261
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,160
I would have liked more peaches in there, 

262
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,520
there's a high proportion of frangipane. 

263
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,440
You're miles away from the flavour points. 

264
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,280
That does not taste of anything, you get the odd peach, sourness, 

265
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,120
no sweetness. 

266
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,000
It's very, very bland and dry. 

267
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,240
I love your style but please remember the substance. 

268
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,680
OK. 

269
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,480
Good colour underneath. 

270
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,080
That rhubarb has lost a lot of its colour, hasn't it? 

271
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,080
I would have cooked that for less time and we've ended up with 

272
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,800
two thick layers of pastry and a very thin layer of rhubarb. 

273
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,920
Holding quite well. Let's have a look at the bottom. 

274
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,800
That is a beautifully baked underneath. 

275
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,760
- The pastry taste is good. I think it's a nice pie.
- OK, thanks. 

276
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:25,080
I like that. I do, that's a real sort of family fruit pie. 

277
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,080
- The flavour's lovely.
- Thanks, Ruby. 

278
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,560
Looks pretty crumbly, the pastry. 

279
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,680
OK, that's an issue for me. 

280
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,280
You can have it crumbly, yes, but not that crumbly, 

281
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,200
you need to bind it together more. 

282
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,920
I always go on about over-working, but you under-worked that one. 

283
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,240
Such a nice idea to put sage in the pastry 

284
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,160
but I really couldn't taste the sage. 

285
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,360
OK, thank you. 

286
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,680
A lot of liquid in there. 

287
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,760
Shall I put my water wings on? 

288
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,880
If you're going to have that amount of juice, somehow or other 

289
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,040
it's got to be thickened or it would make the pastry wet underneath. 

290
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,600
I did put a little cornflour in. 

291
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,200
- A little?
- Yes, but I didn't think it was enough. 

292
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,720
Might have needed a bit more. 

293
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,080
One of my pet hates in a pie is a soggy bottom, 

294
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,240
you've managed to get a soggy top. 

295
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,360
Bit of midwifery required here, there we go. 

296
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,880
The pastry is not cooked, particularly in the middle. 

297
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,960
Never got ginger in that mouthful... 

298
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,560
or the next one. 

299
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,640
- I think the fruit's cooked perfectly but as an apple.
- It's an apple pie. 

300
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,000
But you need to try your food. 

301
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,160
If you don't try your food, you do not know what that's going to taste like. 

302
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,440
Thank you. 

303
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,080
That was bad, it was really bad. 

304
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,960
I always knew my fruit pie was going to be terrible 

305
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,200
because I think fruit pies are terrible. 

306
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,280
It had a soggy bottom, the pastry on the top wasn't cooked, double boo. 

307
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,480
It feels great when they say they like the flavours. 

308
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,520
Apart from getting a decent bake, you want them 

309
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,480
to have something that tastes delicious. 

310
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,320
It went wrong from the very beginning 

311
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,480
and from then on I was onto a losing streak, really. 

312
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,400
Perhaps I should have just kept going rather than starting again. 

313
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,800
Excuse me, so stupid, I don't do things like this normally! 

314
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,280
SHE SNIFFS 

315
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
It just gets to you. 

316
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,240
With confidence knocked, some of the bakers are desperate to prove 

317
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,920
themselves in the next challenge. 

318
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,760
Unfortunately for them, it's the Technical. 

319
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,840
Bakers, good afternoon. And welcome to the Technical Challenge. 

320
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,920
I think you can see there's a little smile hovering around Paul's lips. 

321
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,280
Yes, it is one of his recipes. 

322
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,360
Now, as ever, Mary and Paul are not allowed to know who has baked what, 

323
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,760
- so, with the greatest respect... 
- Goodbye.
- ..jog on. 

324
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,440
- Thank you.
- Good luck. 

325
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,280
Anyway, now they've gone, let's shut the tent doors and have a rave. 

326
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:24,120
OK, now, the Technical Challenge. This week...custard tarts. 

327
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,000
12 individual custard tarts 

328
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,200
and what we're looking for is golden pastry-crimped cups with a fantastic 

329
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,480
layer of even, smooth custard, with just a little bit of wobble in it. 

330
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,840
- You've got two hours. 
- On your marks...
- Get set...
- ..bake! 

331
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,840
The egg custard tart. 

332
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,880
Love custard tarts, love some custard tarts. 

333
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,520
Never thought to make one, though. Perhaps I should have. 

334
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,360
A British classic and elegant in its simplicity. 

335
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,640
I have made them before, it's not the easiest thing to make. 

336
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,320
Formed of an outer sweet pastry crust, 

337
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,640
it's filled with egg custard, dusted with nutmeg, and baked. 

338
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,280
This could go wrong in so many ways. 

339
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,840
They look absolutely wonderful. 

340
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,400
Beautifully formed, it's solid, the pastry is baked. 

341
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,680
You can see it's got a beautiful colour all the way around, 

342
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,520
- no soggy bottoms there. 
- Beautifully brown across the base. 

343
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
When you look at the custard, you can see it's level, 

344
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:37,040
it's got a slight wobble to it, but if I cut this open...look at that. 

345
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,640
The custard is perfectly cooked, it's creamy and it's smooth. 

346
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,080
Baked well, there is nothing better than a good custard tart. 

347
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:54,080
Right, flour, almonds, 120 grams of chilled butter. 

348
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,640
Just incorporating the butter into the mixture, 

349
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,520
and when I get breadcrumb texture, I'll add in the egg. 

350
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,720
The dough should be worked more than a regular sweet crust 

351
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,440
to create a pastry that's robust... 

352
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,360
We don't want the custard all seeping through. 

353
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,480
..without becoming chewy. 

354
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,560
It's a happy medium between both, I think. 

355
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,960
While the pastry rests, the bakers ponder the next step. 

356
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,680
"Make the custard filling." Helpful(!) 

357
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:29,040
Just deciding whether I should cook the custard or not. 

358
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,680
So I'm just heating my custard through, 

359
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,520
just for it to thicken slightly. 

360
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,320
I think it's not that type of tart, I think 

361
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,600
to get it to set right, it needs to go in raw and bake in the oven. 

362
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,120
Looking round, some people haven't necessarily heated theirs, 

363
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,760
and I'm doing that whole comparing. 

364
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:54,360
This is what happens, you start doubting everything and stuff. 

365
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,400
Do you feel safe doing the Technical? Is it quite nice? 

366
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,400
- No. 
- HE LAUGHS 

367
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,680
I feel a bag of nerves. 

368
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,160
Dreaming Bake Off dreams? 

369
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,560
I think they're all doing that. 

370
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,960
- Have you dreamt about Paul and Mary in the dreams?
- Not yet, it's going to happen. 

371
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,160
Who would you rather dream about, Paul or Mary? 

372
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,680
- That would be telling, wouldn't it?
- Oh, hello. 

373
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,000
THEY LAUGH 

374
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,560
'60 minutes to go.' 

375
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,760
Time is already against us. 

376
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,640
Howard's rolling, does that mean I should be rolling? 

377
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,120
It's going to be quite thin, because you need 12 that size, 

378
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,800
because that's the size that fits into the tin. 

379
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,080
The pastry should reach the top of the mould. 

380
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,160
Looking around the room, everybody else managed to 

381
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,520
get their pastry up the sides, I was the only one who didn't so I thought, 

382
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,840
"I'll build up the sides." Providing they come out, I'll live with it. 

383
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,720
HE LAUGHS 

384
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,200
The custard should be filled to the top of the pastry. 

385
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,240
Obviously I don't want to overfill them but I don't want a huge 

386
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,960
rim of pastry around the outside with no custard. 

387
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,040
Doing this in the oven CAN help prevent spilling. 

388
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,080
It says on the recipe, "Nutmeg to taste." 

389
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,960
The problem is it's not my taste I'm trying to satisfy. 

390
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,680
HE LAUGHS 

391
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,640
Oh, stop it, Glenn! Pouring like a buffoon. 

392
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,040
To increase the chances of an even batch, 

393
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,000
both trays should be baked on the same shelf. 

394
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,440
OK. 

395
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,200
HE GROANS 

396
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,280
The egg custard tart may seem like the humblest of old friends, 

397
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,840
but, in fact, its origins are way more illustrious. 

398
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,880
It first found favour in the courts of Richard II 

399
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,360
as a decadent treat, his recipe recorded for posterity 

400
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,760
by royal chefs for Britain's oldest cookery book. 

401
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
England's oldest known cook book, 

402
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,280
written by the chief master cooks of King Richard II, 

403
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:15,240
the Forme of Cury is one of the best-known records of medieval cooking. 

404
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,760
To translate the Middle English title, 

405
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,160
"forme" means method and "cury" means cooking. 

406
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,360
The manuscript is exactly as it came to the library, 

407
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,920
so you can see that the original binding has been preserved. 

408
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,360
It's quite greasy, you can imagine it being actually used in a kitchen. 

409
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,840
It dates from the 1390s and was commissioned by the master 

410
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,800
chefs of King Richard II, so it's a royal cookery book. 

411
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,920
And it contains 194 recipes, which range from porridge and stew. 

412
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,200
There are also lots of dessert dishes, 

413
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,520
so we're seeing the introduction of sugar, for example, which was 

414
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,160
extremely expensive at the time, and it's a way of demonstrating 

415
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,360
the luxury that the household could afford. 

416
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,480
Richard II's kitchen had over 300 staff making hundreds of recipes, 

417
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,920
many of which are immortalised in the Forme of Cury, ranging 

418
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,480
from cooking porpoise to the more recognisable sweet custard tarts. 

419
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,640
There's an interesting group of desserts that 

420
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,520
develop in the Forme of Cury. 

421
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,400
And these are the English sweet custards, 

422
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,280
so you have doucettes, you have flattons and you have darioles. 

423
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,360
The dariole is very similar to the modern English custard tart. 

424
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,280
Cow's milk did not keep for long in medieval kitchens, 

425
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,280
so almond milk was often used as a substitute. 

426
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,160
This was mixed with eggs, sugar, and saffron, 

427
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,040
which at the time was valued as highly as gold. 

428
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,440
These were very rich desserts, and, of course, suited Richard 

429
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,800
because it was the sort of decadence he wanted to show, 

430
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,880
that richness of desserts and richness of food which he 

431
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,800
wanted to display in the English court at the time. 

432
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,960
But such excess cost a fortune and he taxed his subjects to 

433
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,040
pay for it, thus losing the support of Parliament. 

434
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,280
In 1399, his cousin challenged the throne and Richard was 

435
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,880
incarcerated and starved to death at just 33 years old. 

436
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,840
Perhaps his greatest legacy was the nation's oldest cook book. 

437
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,760
Back in the tent, the bakers are hoping for a happier ending. 

438
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,000
The oven must be hot enough to bake the pastry, 

439
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,880
but not so hot that it boils the custard. 

440
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,680
I can see Howard looking into his oven, Christine behind me 

441
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,040
looking into her oven. If you look up, you'll see no-one 

442
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,600
because everyone's on their knees looking at the oven. 

443
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,680
I'm going to have a look. 

444
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,800
Oh, it's a completely different story on the top than on the bottom. 

445
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,080
They are not browning at the same rate. 

446
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,640
It's just a question of when do I pull them? 

447
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,640
Because I'll need some time for them to cool or I won't get them out. 

448
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,680
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes with the tarts. 15 minutes. 

449
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,360
Normally you need about an hour for it to cool before you take it out. 

450
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,880
Oh, God. 

451
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,920
Think I might be in trouble with this one. 

452
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,720
I think they'll have to come out. 

453
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,080
They're even. 

454
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,720
The pastry's too soft. Oh, God! 

455
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,120
Oh, you are ugly cousins of those bad boys. 

456
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,920
I'm putting mine in the freezer 

457
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,920
How on earth do you get these out? 

458
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,640
I have not got a clue. 

459
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,240
Don't look at procedure. 

460
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:12,000
Oh, dear, it's definitely not my weekend. 

461
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,800
This pastry is just completely not done. 

462
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,120
Two minutes, bakers, two minutes. 

463
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,440
Desperate times, desperate measures. 

464
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,880
SHE SIGHS 

465
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,840
HE SIGHS 

466
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,160
(Oh, Jesus!) 

467
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,320
I don't have time for this. 

468
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,400
(Sugar.) 

469
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,440
No. 

470
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,080
Oh, my giddy aunt! 

471
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,080
Oh, no, look at that. 

472
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,800
HE SIGHS 

473
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,680
Oh! 

474
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,520
Bakers, your time's up. 

475
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,520
That's it. Please step away from the tarts, thank you. 

476
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,600
OK. 

477
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,320
What we're looking for is 12 perfectly formed custard tarts, 

478
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,560
that's 12 custard tarts. 

479
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
Shall we start from this side, Mary? 

480
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,080
Yes. 

481
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,480
Pastry looks a nice colour. 

482
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,880
Pastry looks OK. And it looks as though it's set as well. 

483
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,600
- It's a good bake, that one. 
- It's a good custard tart, isn't it? 

484
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,080
It's a nice custard tart, that. 

485
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,720
And we'll move onto the next one. 

486
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,320
They've got a nice bake underneath, Paul. 

487
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,760
It's a good custard 

488
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,080
but because they're a bit shallower, you don't get quite enough 

489
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,800
custard for the amount of pastry. 

490
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,600
Oh, dear. 

491
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,560
I bet they were quite difficult to get out of the cases. 

492
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,520
Bit soggy at the bottom. 

493
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,920
Tastes OK. 

494
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,080
It's far too shallow. 

495
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,280
They are baked and have got a good colour round. 

496
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,280
Nice short pastry. 

497
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,120
It's baked but this has been rushed. 

498
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:27,680
The pastry's just so weak, let's have a look. 

499
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,640
It's not long enough in the oven and it's not set. 

500
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:36,600
Oh, dear. Raw pastry. Where are the other six? 

501
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,600
Again, not long enough in the oven. 

502
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,480
The pastry's totally undercooked underneath, isn't it? 

503
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,080
Custard's good. 

504
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,400
Move on to the next one. 

505
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,880
Again, we're missing half of them. Have we got one that's any good? 

506
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,960
I'm not even going to attempt that one, that's got major issues. 

507
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,280
Major issues. Right, next one. 

508
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,280
They're shallow, they're under-baked, custard's just about set. 

509
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,840
They're neat and they match. 

510
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,600
Yes. Finally, the last one. Just done but they're so shallow. 

511
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,080
It's quite raw again, isn't it? 

512
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,360
It's decision time, 

513
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,480
and Paul and Mary will name the bakers in reverse order. 

514
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,160
Right, in ninth place is this one. Whose is this? Glenn. 

515
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,680
It's underbaked. You've knackered them all bringing them 

516
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,640
out of the cases. The custard was scrambled egg as well. 

517
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,080
And this is number eight, who is that? 

518
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,280
You haven't got the right number, the pastry wasn't quite done, 

519
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,800
not quite set. 

520
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,560
And in seventh position it's this. 

521
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,840
The custard's fallen down the side 

522
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,960
and obviously, the walls of the cases have all collapsed as well. 

523
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,480
Ruby, Howard and Kimberley have not done enough to 

524
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,080
place in the top three. 

525
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,240
Number three is this one. 

526
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,800
They're getting better, you've got a good height there. 

527
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,400
And number two is right here. Who's that? 

528
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,720
They were a little bit small, they were very delicious. 

529
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,400
So that leaves number one. Who's this? 

530
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,480
MEL AND SUE: Well done, Frances. 

531
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,880
They tasted good, the consistency of the custard was good 

532
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,200
and the decoration on the top was good as well. Well done. 

533
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,120
I feel a lot better than I did a couple of hours ago. I hope the 

534
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,880
whole style over substance thing I can be putting a little bit to rest. 

535
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,520
I felt I would be OK this week and so far I haven't disappointed 

536
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,080
myself, so hopefully tomorrow will be on the same sort of level. 

537
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,840
Pretty much everything that could have gone wrong went wrong, 

538
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,680
I'm gutted. Gutted. 

539
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,840
I can categorically say I won't be Star Baker this week. 

540
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,640
Be lucky if I stay, at this rate. 

541
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:58,000
It could not have gone worse today. The pressure's on for tomorrow. 

542
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,680
Whatever I present to Paul 

543
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,520
and Mary, I'm going to make sure it's the best that I am, as a baker. 

544
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,000
A brand-new day in the Bake Off tent. 

545
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,920
And a last chance to impress the judges. 

546
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,880
Morning, bakers. Great to see you all here. 

547
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,400
Now, some words to think about for this morning. 

548
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,000
Big, impressive, Showstopper. 

549
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,360
It's got to be, please, a filo pastry pie. 

550
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,960
You can use any inspiration from the classics, 

551
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:47,200
like a Greek spanakopita, or a Moroccan pastilla, apparently, 

552
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,920
or go mad, invent your own. 

553
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,080
Break those pie boundaries. 

554
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,120
Although a spanakopita will be hard today, 

555
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,800
- because we don't have any spanners in the tent.
- Except for me. 

556
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,720
The most important thing is that the pastry is made from scratch. 

557
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,560
It can be freeform or it could be in a tin, shape it how you want. 

558
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,440
You've got four hours to complete this challenge. On your marks... 

559
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,440
- Get set...
- Bake! 

560
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,240
Notoriously difficult to work with, 

561
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,040
filo pastry is the nemesis of many bakers. 

562
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,240
The stress is a whole new level. 

563
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:23,080
But I'd take the stress any day to stay another week. 

564
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:28,240
A basic filo dough combines water, a little fat and high-gluten flour. 

565
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:34,240
I've got 00 pasta flour because of the elasticity, and I'm 

566
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,240
adding a little bit of vinegar and olive oil to that with the water. 

567
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,520
The acid tenderises the strong glutens that have built up 

568
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,840
to create the stretch needed for huge wafer-thin sheets of dough. 

569
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,520
This is the alchemy of baking. 

570
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,760
Filo pastry, it's a great test. 

571
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,840
Very, very tricky to do. You've got to work at it, you've got to work 

572
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,520
at it, you've got to build it up, stretch it, it's like a membrane. 

573
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,120
You've got to open it up, see the gluten strands in it, 

574
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,640
throw it over a newspaper and see if you can read it. 

575
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,480
Not only have they got to make good pastry, they've got to be creative. 

576
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,000
This is the Showstopper, it's got to be big. 

577
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,560
We've got to look at it 

578
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,960
and think that they have created something special. 

579
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:23,120
My pie is going to be a fresh fig and feta filo flan, which is 

580
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,600
a bit of a mouthful. 

581
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,160
Howard's tongue-twisting bake is made up of lots of small 

582
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,400
sheets of pastry baked in a decorative mould. 

583
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,480
- Can I see it?
- Yes, of course. 

584
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,560
Oh, nice. 

585
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,360
So will it be hard to get it out of there? 

586
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,640
It's a devil to get out, it's terrible to get out. 

587
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,040
Good luck, Howard. 

588
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,400
- Yes, nice.
- Thank you. 

589
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,960
I'm going to surpass anything I've ever done before today. 

590
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,480
That's my plan. 

591
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,520
To do that, Christine's making a feta and roasted vegetable 

592
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,520
filo pie, inspired by a Mediterranean family picnic. 

593
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,960
I've made it seven times, most of that in one week, 

594
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,280
just to try and get it right, and I'm hoping that will pay off today. 

595
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,800
The first big hurdle is the kneading. 

596
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,960
To build up the vast network of gluten vital to a dough 

597
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,360
that'll be stretched and rolled so thinly... 

598
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,120
Ah, it's nearly ready. 

599
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,960
..elbow grease is required. 

600
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,560
See this is the way to do it. 

601
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,280
All that hard work Ruby's doing - I'm having a cup of tea. 

602
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,720
I entertained the idea of doing a savoury one but I never cook. 

603
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,640
Basically, I can't cook. I can bake but I can't cook. 

604
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,480
So that's why I've steered clear of savoury. 

605
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,680
Instead, Ruby's making a sweet rose-shaped pie filled with almond 

606
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,640
and zesty orange flavours from three large sheets of filo. 

607
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,760
So how are you going to get that so thin 

608
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,120
so you can read a newspaper through it? 

609
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,000
Rolling it out, I've got a floured cloth, 

610
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,680
and I've been stretching it over my arms, pulling it bit by bit 

611
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,240
and letting its own weight do a bit of the work as well. 

612
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,960
Have you had space in your student room to do that, Ruby? 

613
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,200
- Everything's covered in flour. 
- Show us your technique, Ruby, then. 

614
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,480
I'm scared I'll end up hitting one of you. 

615
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,800
That's all right. Do it front of Mary, it's fine. 

616
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,320
She's got a good slap, Mary, hasn't she? 

617
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
Go on, you have a go, Mary. 

618
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,840
You are rotten. 

619
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,960
Give it a good slapping, Mary, go on. 

620
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,560
There is steel in those arms. 

621
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,040
Blue steel. 

622
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,080
As some of the bakers rest their dough... 

623
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,000
I just find a shower cap quite handy, 

624
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,760
just gives it a nice seal, really. 

625
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,680
..Rob's using his expert knowledge on his star ingredient. 

626
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,160
I joined a local mushroom club. I do like to forage, it is a 

627
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,360
very unforgiving pastime. 

628
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,160
You get it wrong and you can pay the hell of a price. 

629
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,280
The opportunity to kill yourself is quite good. 

630
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,400
Some mushrooms, you eat them and there is no cure, you just dissolve. 

631
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,360
It's not very nice. 

632
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,760
To avoid the dangers of forage mushrooms, he's using 

633
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,040
shop-bought ones in his spanakopita. 

634
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,840
He also has a mathematical approach to his filo. 

635
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,720
- This is "Pie-thagoras", this pie. 
- Pie-thagoras! 

636
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,560
It'll be made up of either a number of triangles or some rectangles, 

637
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,200
I haven't decided yet. It depends how it folds. 

638
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,640
So it's a plethora of Pie-thagoras pies. 

639
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,040
Well, good luck, mate. Looking forward to this one. 

640
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,920
I hope not to disappoint. 

641
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,400
Baking's not food on a table. Baking's a bit of love - 

642
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,320
that's why we do it. 

643
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,280
A lover of Greek food, Glenn is also making spanakopita 

644
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,160
out of just one enormous filo sheet. 

645
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,240
He's decided to add walnuts to his spinach and feta filling. 

646
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,520
If I do this pie as well as I have done it at home, 

647
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,280
I've got nothing to worry about. 

648
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,000
If it goes pear-shaped I could be on my way home, but I'm not going 

649
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,560
to dwell on that, I'm going to go to my happy place and get on with it. 

650
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,440
I'm just making a mix of cream cheese, ricotta, 

651
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,000
orange blossom honey, orange and lemon zest, 

652
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,760
and it will be studded with my morello cherries. 

653
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,280
Frances is making a baklava crafted into a cherry tree, 

654
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,360
with pistachio cigarillos for branches. 

655
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,720
Of course, she is. 

656
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,800
I know that there'll be a design factor here, 

657
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,320
but I hope you've got really good flavours this time. 

658
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,400
Yes, within the filo layers, there's going to be a pistachio 

659
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,200
baklava layer, and within that centre core, I'm making a ricotta 

660
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,200
and cream cheese, and orange blossom with orange zest. 

661
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,560
Frances, are there going to be squirrels 

662
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,400
and birds nesting in the tree? 

663
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,600
A tree house? 

664
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,920
There's no squirrels, no. 

665
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,840
I think on your head be it, it's quite complicated. 

666
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,440
It sounds really complicated. 

667
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,800
I hope it comes out, good luck. 

668
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,320
Can't wait to taste it. 

669
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,280
Ali, Beca and Kimberley are inspired by North African flavours. 

670
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,520
I'm using Ras el hanout spice, which is a North African spice blend. 

671
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,920
The chicken and bacon go quite nicely together, 

672
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,080
just kind of things I like to eat all in one pie. 

673
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,480
SHE LAUGHS 

674
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,200
Kimberley has added turmeric to her filo, and has packed her 

675
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,720
chicken, bacon and butternut squash pie full of tastes and textures. 

676
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,200
I'm doing a garnish for the top which is going to be pork and 

677
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,280
chicken crackling mixed with some smoked garlic and fresh coriander. 

678
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,960
Is this the crackling here? 

679
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,240
Yeah. 

680
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,360
I can see that you're really excited about doing this, aren't you? 

681
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,160
You can't wait to get going. 

682
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,080
I really like this pie, I think it's really tasty. 

683
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:32,240
Beca's use of familiar vegetables is spiced up with a hint of Morocco. 

684
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,600
My husband proposed to me when we were in Morocco, you see, 

685
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,280
and we had this amazing meal in Marrakech, I just love the colours. 

686
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,560
I love Moroccan cuisine, I love Moroccan flavours, 

687
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,120
they're really bright, they wake you up and wake your senses. 

688
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,000
A cup of tea, a slice of this, it's awesome. 

689
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,120
Ali is making an orange, cardamom and date m'hanncha, 

690
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,200
translated as a "snake cake". 

691
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,040
And are you going to roll it out to what length? 

692
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,040
About two metres when I practised at home. 

693
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,440
Two metres?! Longer than this bench! 

694
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,600
Yeah. 

695
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,120
Good luck. Nice flavours, classic flavours, but I like the idea. 

696
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,400
The ancient Greek word "filo" means "leaf", 

697
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,400
which means it has to be rolled pretty thinly. 

698
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,680
The more transparent the pastry, the finer 

699
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,480
and flakier the crust will become. 

700
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,240
I'm not great, actually, I must admit. 

701
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,800
A big sheet, the filo, 

702
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,160
so I'm working with kind of more manageable sizes. It takes me 

703
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:33,400
two hours to get all of these rolled out so I need to crack on, really. 

704
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,200
I'm using an oklava today - 

705
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,520
it's a traditional Turkish rolling pin. 

706
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,520
I've got my home-made broomstick. 

707
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,120
What I do like about this is the fact that it's quite long, 

708
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,680
so when the sheets get bigger, 

709
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,360
you know you've got an even thickness of the pastry. 

710
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,760
Once rolled, the filo is stretched. 

711
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:02,760
This can be done in several small sections...or as one giant sheet. 

712
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,240
Ali, do you need all of that bench? 

713
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,600
The thing is, mine's two metres long. 

714
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,200
I'll see what I can do, don't worry. 

715
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,200
- Sorry, Kimberley.
- No worries. 

716
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,640
It's probably the most important bake I'll ever have to do. 

717
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,120
The only way I can stay is that mine is good and someone else is bad. 

718
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,400
And I love everyone here but I'd prefer it if they said it was me. 

719
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,600
- So you're ready to roll? 
- I am indeed. 

720
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,520
Can I help? Can you show me? 

721
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,240
Literally going, "This is my worst nightmare." 

722
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,240
Last one! 

723
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,040
Now this is the most complicated bit. 

724
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,120
That is one large sort of filo snake you need to wrangle. 

725
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,760
Yes. 

726
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,320
Right, what the heck is that? 

727
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:18,200
- Walnut oil.
- Walnut oil, OK.
- Oh! 

728
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,080
In she goes, that's it. 

729
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,560
So I'm on time, but there's no time for things to go wrong. 

730
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,480
There always is. 

731
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,760
I'm well behind schedule. Well behind. 

732
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,080
The mushrooms took rather longer to clean than I anticipated. 

733
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,160
They cost me probably half an hour more than I thought. 

734
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,560
Rob, is there anything I can do to help? 

735
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,320
Trust me, if you could... 

736
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:02,240
The best thing for me to do is just leave, maybe. Shall I get my coat? 

737
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,960
Yeah, sorry, I'll give you a call. 

738
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,080
They all say that. 

739
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,000
HE LAUGHS 

740
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,840
Bakers, you've got half an hour left on this bake. 

741
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,720
Hope that doesn't throw a SPANAKOPITA in the works! 

742
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,640
(Excuse me.) 

743
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,760
Is anybody up there? The god of crisp? 

744
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,160
Please be crispy, please be crispy. 

745
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,160
I can feel that it's crisping up, I'm quite happy with that, 

746
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,240
it's looking quite good for the moment. 

747
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,760
Scruffy. 

748
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,600
Bakers, five minutes left. Five minutes. 

749
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,960
HE LAUGHS 

750
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,120
What a beautiful, beautiful ring. 

751
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,240
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. 

752
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,120
I'm thinking it's OK. 

753
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,320
Oh, dear. 

754
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:27,280
How's that bake looking? What temp have you got it on? 

755
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,880
High. 

756
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,360
- You said before, this is going to be the devil to get out.
- It is. 

757
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:47,960
Anything can happen in this tent of dreams/nightmares. 

758
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,120
Right, OK, what do we need to do? 

759
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,440
Oh, man, this is terrifying! 

760
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,280
Oh, dear. 

761
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,000
It's not good, is it? 

762
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,760
I can't watch this. 

763
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,800
OK, slowly. 

764
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,120
Are we going to the plate? 

765
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,120
Easy, easy! 

766
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,480
All for one, one for all. 

767
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,680
Time's up, bakers, that's it. 

768
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,720
Put the pies on the end of your benches, please. 

769
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,760
How can I be happy with it? It's quite a scruffy job. 

770
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,480
Kimberley, do you want to bring your amazing pie up? 

771
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,400
I think the only thing I'm concerned about is that 

772
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,200
I tried to do something different from a coil, 

773
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,960
and I'm wondering if it looks interesting enough. 

774
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,520
It looks as though it's ready for a party. 

775
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,640
I like the idea of adding the turmeric as well 

776
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,480
to give you that yellow colour. 

777
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,000
Beautiful layers of the actual filo pastry. 

778
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:15,600
I have to say that that is absolutely beautiful. 

779
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,800
The whole lot comes together as one big explosion in the mouth, 

780
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,520
which just tastes and looks fantastic. Well done. 

781
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,960
- SUE: I think they liked it. 
- Thank you so much. 

782
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,280
I think it's cooked through. 

783
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,320
I'm not worried about it not being cooked, 

784
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,720
but there was a bit of scruffiness that resulted from rushing things. 

785
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,000
There you go. 

786
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,520
- Is this Pie-thagoras? 
- This is Pie-thagoras, yes. 

787
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,320
It looks slightly different to the thing that you drew, to be honest. 

788
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,320
It just looks like lots of sort of pasties sitting on a tray. 

789
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,120
It's under-baked underneath. 

790
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,000
Disaster. 

791
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,320
The filling is good. 

792
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,960
All the moisture in the mushrooms has gone through to the filo 

793
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,360
- underneath, that's why it's soggy. 
- Yeah. 

794
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,960
I am dreading Paul cuts through it, takes a bite 

795
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,720
and says he hates it, it's got no flavour. 

796
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,760
But I can't do anything about that now, 

797
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,120
I've just got to hope that he does like the look of it and the taste. 

798
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,280
Again, you've gone to town on the design, 

799
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,520
- and we're just hoping that the flavour is there too.
- So am I. 

800
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,120
I have an issue with the inside. 

801
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,000
There's a reason why baklava is small 

802
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,080
and the layers are thin - it's so it can be baked inside. 

803
00:50:54,080 --> 00:51:00,120
- There are circles uncooked in the middle.
- Style and substance. 

804
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,200
That's a shame. 

805
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,840
I don't think for one moment I'm going to be top of the pops, 

806
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,040
but it would be good not to be at the bottom. 

807
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,880
They look almost individually baked. 

808
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,920
They were joined, but they sort of split apart in the bake. 

809
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,240
I think you've got your flavours right here. 

810
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,480
- The flavours are stunning and you have got a good flake.
- Well done. 

811
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,000
Thank you. 

812
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,960
Happy with it? 

813
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,320
Well, it's a lot better than what I usually knock up, 

814
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,400
- so it's an improvement, I guess. 
- I appreciate your honesty. 

815
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,800
You do know you're on Bake Off, don't you? 

816
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,600
- That is beautiful.
- Thank you. 

817
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,160
- Well done, Ruby, you've done it again.
- Thank you.
- Cracking. 

818
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,600
I love butternut squash. 

819
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,120
I just wonder whether all those vegetables go together. 

820
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,520
If you had some different textures in there... 

821
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,320
I think it loses it because it's all like a mashed potato, basically. 

822
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,960
I like that. Flavours complement each other. 

823
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,800
And I'm delighted that you've got it off the tin. 

824
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:25,000
I see you had tremendous support from a couple of experts here. 

825
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,400
But it landed safely and I think it just looks very elegant. Lovely. 

826
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,680
Paul knows a good spanakopita when he eats one. 

827
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,840
And it could not taste right. Is it enough? 

828
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,920
- Well, who knows?
- Right. 

829
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,720
- Oh, hello.
- Lovely layers in there, really nice layers. 

830
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:56,800
You've done really well underneath there. Look. Crisp. 

831
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,120
I love it. The flake's there, the taste, the spinach. 

832
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:09,840
- So well done, you've done it. 
- Thank you.
- Well done! 

833
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,520
It's all going to be in the taste, to be honest, 

834
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,000
and that's what's petrifying me right now. 

835
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,680
If I mess up on this bake, I'm out. 

836
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,320
It seems to have a flake. Let's have a look. 

837
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,040
Got a good crispy base. 

838
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,800
It tastes good with the almond as well, and the orange coming through. 

839
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,800
It's very similar to baklava, and it's not as sweet, which I like. 

840
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,240
You have put pistachio nuts on the top. 

841
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,440
I'd have liked to see some of those inside as well. 

842
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,640
- It would have added another element of texture as well.
- Thank you. 

843
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,320
Any idea who is in line for Star Baker? 

844
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,000
I thought that Kimberley's was amazing. 

845
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,640
I love the flavour of that, with the chicken and bacon, 

846
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,880
the turmeric in the shell as well. It was delicious. 

847
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,440
She's been very stable as well throughout most of the Bake Off. 

848
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,720
Well, I think Ruby has done very well. 

849
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:43,720
She's a student, and she has absolutely no equipment at all, 

850
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,760
- and yet she gets success. 
- And at the other end of the line? 

851
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,280
When Glenn did his pie, the idea sounded great, 

852
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,200
but unfortunately the custard was pretty useless, it wasn't 

853
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,440
doing anything, and it disappointed me a lot. 

854
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,000
And of course he was last on technical. 

855
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,840
Who else do you think is in trouble? MARY: Ali. 

856
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:07,280
He made some very poor custard tarts and his pie was just not successful. 

857
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,320
Rob had a bit of a nightmare with his mushroom. 

858
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,000
He tried to be too clever. 

859
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,160
We were looking for something stunning to take our breath away - 

860
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:18,680
it's the Showstopper. It didn't look a Showstopper. 

861
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,400
I have one person in mind, who I think has fallen away 

862
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,320
from the rest of the pack, and I just need to talk to Mary 

863
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,880
to see if we've got the same person. 

864
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,120
Hello, bakers. As you know, every week, Paul and Mary 

865
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:46,160
award the accolade of Star Baker, so this week's Star Baker is 

866
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:51,000
someone who produced a cracking tart, someone who puts shrubbery to perfect 

867
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,480
effect in a caramel and produced a lovely ring with a piggy crunch. 

868
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,400
Well done, Kimberley. Congratulations! 

869
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:06,920
Now, sadly, I'm the bearer of not such joyful tidings. 

870
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:15,640
I'm afraid we can't take all of you on our journey. 

871
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,960
There's one person who won't be joining us next week. 

872
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:25,600
And Mary and Paul have decided that that person is... 

873
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,880
- ..Ali.
- That's fine. 

874
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,240
- We're really sorry. 
- Ali, come and get a hug. 

875
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,720
- We're going to miss you. Double hug, come on.
- It's scary, but go with it. 

876
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,160
I don't want to go. Before, I did everything. 

877
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,880
I prayed, and my prayer was, please, let me go through. 

878
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:53,120
But if I don't, then I know that's for the best. 

879
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:57,000
'This morning, going into the Showstopper, I was anxious.' 

880
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,360
It was scary. 

881
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,240
I knew if I got it wrong, I could go, 

882
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,120
and I knew if I did all right, it could be safe. 

883
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,520
And... Yeah, you start to really care. 

884
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,960
Just carry on baking. You're brilliant. You'll get there. 

885
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,320
I feel very sorry for Ali, but I'm pleased for myself, obviously. 

886
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,080
I'm through to the next week. That's good. 

887
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:24,440
It's a really bittersweet feeling. 

888
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,960
I'm clearly happy with myself that I'm still in there, 

889
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,400
but it's just really, really sad to see somebody go. 

890
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,480
I didn't feel any relief, and that's perfectly honest, 

891
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,640
because I was so sad for Ali. 

892
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:43,840
He's just a lovely, kind, nice man, 

893
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,560
and I will really miss him. 

894
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,360
If you don't keep in touch, I'll kill you. 

895
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:53,960
Kimberley deserved to be Star Baker, she was absolutely fantastic. 

896
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,240
Her Showstopper was one of the best things I've tried for ages. 

897
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,120
It was great. It's lovely. 

898
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,640
It's a really nice endorsement of my baking this weekend, 

899
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,400
so I'm really pleased. 

900
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,960
The Bake Off meant a hell of a lot to me. 

901
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,760
I've learned so much and I'm going to walk out with my head high. 

902
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,600
'Next time: The bakers take on biscuits...' 

903
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,200
Just drizzle the living heck out of it. 

904
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,840
'..with a signature tray bake that sees some crumble...' 

905
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,360
- Stop!
- I can't. 
- It's just a blackberry! 

906
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,320
'..the thinnest Technical Challenge ever...' 

907
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,560
Oh, no, I've got a break. 

908
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,200
'And a Showstopper...' 

909
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,600
A Dalek. 

910
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,600
'..that puts their Bake Off dreams in the balance.' 

911
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,520
Oh, I feel sick baking this. 

912
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,920
Yes, you're OK. 

913
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:58,520
