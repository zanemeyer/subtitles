00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Welcome back to Somerset. 

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,200
And, crucially, we're at the halfway point 

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,640
in our mission to find Britain's best amateur baker. 

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,800
So far, we've had chocolate breeze blocks, 

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,560
we've had skyscraper meringues, and collapsed caramels. 

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,200
As Celine Dion would say, "Things are getting serious." 

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,520
As Mary Berry would say, "Get your oven gloves on." 

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,320
It's the Great British Bake-Off. 

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,120
It's round five of the Bake-Off. The standard is higher than ever. 

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,000
It's not like life or death any more, 

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,320
it's not about good bakes and bad bakes - that's it. 

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,480
I do put my heart and soul into everything I bake, and I just want them to see 

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,480
that everything that I am about is baking. 

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,800
Last week, desserts were on the menu. 

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,800
I like the total originality of your presentation. 

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,160
Brendan was Star Baker. 

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,320
Slop! 

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,880
But it proved to be Stuart's last course. 

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,040
- It looks....
- Messy. 

20
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,560
You have good days and bad days, and for me, unfortunately, it's been a bad weekend. 

21
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,840
This week, the bakers take on pies. 

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,640
For me, the onus is purely on the pastry itself. 

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,400
Oh, my goodness! Look at that! 

24
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,080
- But who will pull out all the stops? 
- It's out! It's out, it's out! 

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,720
- Sheer perfection. 
- And who will sink under pressure? 

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,880
I'm completely out of my depth. 

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,680
If that collapses on me again, I don't know what I'll do. 

28
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,840
There's no plan B. 

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,080
- I don't like that. 
- The taste is not very appealing. 

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,320
Argh! 

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,080
3.14... 

32
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,920
1592... 

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,480
2837... 

34
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,720
64... 

35
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,120
- 2...
- 3. 

36
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,760
It's pie week. 

37
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,480
Eight remaining bakers, three pie-making challenges, 

38
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,040
two days in the marquee - 

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,800
one baker will be leaving. 

40
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,880
Bakers, welcome to pie week.. Very exciting. 

41
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,880
Now, for your first challenge, 

42
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,360
which is of course your signature challenge, 

43
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,720
we would like you to make a centrepiece classic - 

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,200
a Wellington. 

45
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,040
Now, Paul has specified it's at least eight inches long, 

46
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,080
it needs to be completely covered with pastry, the rest is up to you. 

47
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,960
- You've got three hours, so on your marks...
- Get set... 

48
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,560
bake! 

49
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,160
'Wellingtons are traditionally made with beef, 

50
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,560
'and wrapped in a pastry crust to keep the meat moist.' 

51
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,240
The Wellington challenge is all about the pastry itself. 

52
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,920
Yes, I am looking for some interesting fillings, 

53
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,680
but more importantly, 

54
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,000
I just want to see a great pastry. 

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,400
We will be looking for a lovely even bake, 

56
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,160
underneath too - no soggy bottoms. 

57
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,000
And it must rise in layers and flakes. 

58
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,240
'Manisha and James are both attempting puff pastry, 

59
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,240
'the big daddy of the pastry world, 

60
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,200
'and infamously tricky to make. 

61
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,720
'But the traditional choice for Wellington.' 

62
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,080
Puff pastry is notorious... 

63
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,480
for its complexity, 

64
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,080
although hopefully this will go OK. 

65
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,520
'The butter's added in a single slab 

66
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,400
'and is rolled, folded and rested six times, 

67
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,880
'creating a layer of butter between each layer of dough. 

68
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,640
'In a hot oven, the moisture in the dough turns to steam, 

69
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,400
'which pushes up as it evaporates, 

70
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,320
'creating the "puff" in the pastry.' 

71
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,880
I mean, who makes their own puff pastry these days? No-one. 

72
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,160
It's quite enjoyable to make your own puff pastry - 

73
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,400
when it turns out right. 

74
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,480
'Manisha's attempting a lamb Wellington with rosemary and mint.' 

75
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,120
I don't make this at home at all. 

76
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,640
It's like the second time I'm making this. 

77
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,920
If it goes down well today I'll probably make it more often. 

78
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,280
I've only made this a couple of times, 

79
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,480
but yeah, it's been really good both times. 

80
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm making a "four little pigs" Wellington. 

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,760
It's got four cuts of pork. 

82
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,120
We've got pork fillet, 

83
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,920
gammon, smoked gammon, 

84
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,920
prosciutto ham, and black pudding. 

85
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,840
'Most of the bakers are making rough puff pastry. 

86
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,120
'It won't rise as much as its puff-pastry cousin 

87
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,720
'and its texture won't be as fine, 

88
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,240
'but it's quicker to make, 

89
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,520
'as chunks of butter are simply mixed into the flour.' 

90
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,960
The trickiest part is that you've got to make sure not only that the pastry is cooked and not soggy, 

91
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,400
but also that the meat's cooked 

92
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,400
The pastry's got be laminated, but it won't rise too much cos it's wrapped around something, 

93
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,040
but there needs to be that lamination 

94
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,480
that Paul and Mary both look for. 

95
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,960
Every element is a potential pitfall for me today. 

96
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,920
But we all like a challenge. 

97
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,120
'Law student John is surrounding his cut of venison 

98
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,400
'with a layer of haggis and porcini pate, 

99
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,880
'all wrapped in Parma ham.' 

100
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,880
It's an interesting blend with the venison and haggis. 

101
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,480
- It should go quite well together. 
- Yes.
- Pastry, it's a nice one. 

102
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,120
- That's its final turn now. 
- Are you doing book or single? 

103
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,200
- Sorry?
- Book turns or single turns? 

104
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,880
- Just like an envelope.
- Single turns. 

105
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,200
Book turn...you go one, two, and then you go over. 

106
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,360
- I might try that actually. 
- It's like a double-turn, really. 

107
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,680
- MARY: It's one more layer, isn't it? 
- I'll give it a go. 

108
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,840
Can't moan about one more layer, can we, eh? 

109
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,840
I'm not amazing at pastry. 

110
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,480
But I'm OK at pastry. 

111
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,720
And this is going to be, I think, the biggest challenge. 

112
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,520
Everything is tricky about this bake. Everything. 

113
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,680
The meat, the pastry, the bits that you put with it, 

114
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,280
everything is really tricky about this. 

115
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,320
And they all have to be good. 

116
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,280
Danny's the only baker making a vegetarian Wellington. 

117
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,520
I'm just making the rough puff pastry at the moment. 

118
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,920
And then I'll move on to the actual filling of the Wellington, 

119
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,440
which is going to be chickpeas, peppers and spinach. 

120
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,640
And then it's going to have some garlic mushrooms around it. 

121
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,320
'Last week's Star Baker Brendan 

122
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,280
'is breaking from tradition with the fish Wellington. 

123
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,800
'Salmon, eggs, rice, mushrooms and spinach, 

124
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,920
'all wrapped in a Scandinavian-style pastry made using quark, 

125
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,760
'an un-aged cheese similar to fromage frais.' 

126
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,280
Tell us a little bit more about this pastry. 

127
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,800
It's equal quantities of butter, strong flour and quark. 

128
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,240
Half a teaspoon of baking powder, 

129
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,400
normally they put in one to one-and-a-half, but I'm reducing it, 

130
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,240
because the more baking powder you put in, it loses it's flakiness. 

131
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,920
And a little salt, and that's it. 

132
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,240
The binding agent is the quark cheese. 

133
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,040
So it's not very strong in flavour, the cheese, 

134
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,240
but it will complement, I think, the salmon. 

135
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,440
'The filling in a Wellington can make the pastry soggy, 

136
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,720
'so using pate, pancakes,

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,520
'or a thin ham to create a protective seal stops the juices seeping out.'

00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,160
My mum works at a butcher's on a Saturday, 

139
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,520
and all are a little bit obsessed with the sausages. 

140
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,760
We all love big breakfasts and stuff, 

141
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,280
so it is kind of what the family like. 

142
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,360
Basically, it's a glorified sausage roll.

00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,760
Eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, and black pudding. 

146
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,200
No baked beans, Cathryn? 

147
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,680
- No baked beans.
- That's sad. 

148
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,440
- Baked beans on the side.
- Good. 

149
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,880
- What pastry are you going to be using?
- Flaky pastry. 

150
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,720
Flaky pastry. It sounds good. 

151
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,560
I think that sounds lovely, and I like the idea of the Parma ham. 

152
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,440
Because it has such a good, strong flavour. 

153
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,120
And also, it's not porous, 

154
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,880
because you don't want any of that wet mixture to go into the pastry. 

155
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,440
'Photographer Ryan is taking a chance with an unconventional recipe. 

156
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,560
'A sea bass en croute, with Malaysian curry powder and puy lentils.' 

157
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
The thing that's dangerous for this recipe is 

158
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,520
I'm using a lot of things that are quite wet. 

159
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,880
I'm making puy lentils, I'm boiling that, 

160
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,160
so that's a lot of liquid intake on there. 

161
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,040
I'm using onions, there'll be a lot of liquid there, 

162
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,440
obviously liquid from the fish. 

163
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,560
And so if that steams up it might make the pastry soft. 

164
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,960
OK, bakers, that's half-time. 

165
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,560
Give your pastry some welly, 

166
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,360
because you got an hour and a half left. 

167
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,880
I need to hurry the hell up! 

168
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,680
The key to a successful Wellington is to partly cook the filling 

169
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,040
and allow it to cool before it's wrapped in the pastry. 

170
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,560
If the filling is hot when the pastry is put together, 

171
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,360
the fat in the pastry will melt and the shape collapse. 

172
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,720
- My goodness, that's massive! 
- It's huge. 

173
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,320
- Isn't it massive? 
- That is beef, yeah?
- I hope so! 

174
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,840
Scary, isn't it? 

175
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,000
It's like the best cut of beef. It's expensive. 

176
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,440
If I mess it up and make it disgusting, that would be awful. 

177
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,000
Sarah-Jane is opting for a traditional beef Wellington 

178
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,560
with a twist of Gorgonzola cheese. 

179
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,240
Why have you got your beef in foil? 

180
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,040
I seared it in the pan and then I roasted it in the oven, 

181
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,480
just for 15 minutes. 

182
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,840
I put it in the foil so that all the steam would stay in 

183
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,560
and try and keep it as most as possible. 

184
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,800
So that's the plan. 

185
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,720
And then you're going to chill it before you put the pastry round? 

186
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,720
I'm not going to chill it, I'm going to leave it resting on the side, 

187
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,880
because I don't want it really, really cold 

188
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,680
when it goes in the oven. 

189
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,120
Because then I won't know how long it takes to cook in the middle 

190
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,840
if it's really, really cold. 

191
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,800
That's the plan, anyway. 

192
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,680
Oh! That's a little bit unstable. 

193
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,640
The Wellingtons should be tightly wrapped, 

194
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,120
or trapped air will become steam 

195
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,880
and cause the pastry to blister and burst in the oven. 

196
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,240
Groovy. That's what we say up north. 

197
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,600
It's going to look a bit like a big Cornish pasty. 

198
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,080
Because it's got the cheese in it, 

199
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,840
when I topped it underneath, the cheese came out of the bottom. 

200
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,200
So I'm going to seal it on the top, to try to keep the cheese in. 

201
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,760
You could do someone a real mischief with that. I mean, that is... 

202
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,440
Yeah, you could. 

203
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,120
I thought we said eight inches? 

204
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,360
I know, and when I've been at home 

205
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,120
it has been kind of... more around that size, 

206
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,200
but I just got carried away today, I think. 

207
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,880
You just thought, "OK, big is best?" 

208
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,680
I can't decide whether to decorate or to score? 

209
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,480
- I'd decorate it. 
- You reckon? I might decorate it. 

210
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,600
You know how Mary loves to see what's on the inside 

211
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,000
replicated on the outside? 

212
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,200
- Oh, no, don't.
- I think you should do a full farmyard scene. 

213
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,920
OK, you need to go in. 

214
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,480
Bakers, that's one hour left, 

215
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,000
so, Cathryn, if you haven't put that one metre-long meat mallet in the oven, it needs to go in now! 

216
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,760
Massive. 

217
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,480
It's just frightening. 

218
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,120
'Timing the bake of a Wellington is key. 

219
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,360
'The filling should be cooked to perfection 

220
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,320
'and the pastry case flaky and golden.' 

221
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,720
Oh, my God almighty... 

222
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,200
Sarah-Jane, keep it in the oven. 

223
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,760
I can't keep it in the oven, John. It's melting. 

224
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,480
I think that the butter has melted in the pastry 

225
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,240
and the whole thing has just collapsed. 

226
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,680
There's absolutely nothing I can do about it. Absolutely nothing. 

227
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,720
Can you not get it out and wrap it in more pastry or something? 

228
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,520
I haven't got any more pastry, that's the only pastry I've got. 

229
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,640
Oh, no... 

230
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,600
This is the worst thing I've ever made in my whole entire life. 

231
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,360
And I've got to serve it to Paul and Mary. 

232
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,640
OK, bakers, 10 minutes. It's just 10 minutes left. 

233
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,280
I've actually... Oh, hello. 

234
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,120
I'm going to leave it one more minute. 

235
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,360
The pastry looks good. 

236
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,520
That's one of the main things, isn't it? 

237
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,120
It helps. 

238
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,200
OK, one minute left, bakers, to get the en croute on a bit of board 

239
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,720
and into my chops. 

240
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,240
I haven't got time. I have to come out. Haven't got time. 

241
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,560
More than slight spillage - massive spillage. 

242
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,800
Bakers, pie time is over. 

243
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,560
Step away from your pies. 

244
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,440
Oh, God... 

245
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:32,160
Each Wellington will now be tasted and judged by Paul and Mary. 

246
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,960
The pastry itself is a little under-baked. 

247
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,360
It looks as though you've got the lamb just right. 

248
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,080
The flavours of the meat, the texture of the meat, is good. 

249
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,440
Unfortunately, the key element that lets it down is the pastry, 

250
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,560
which is what Wellington is all about. 

251
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,720
There's no flake, it has stayed quite raw. 

252
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,840
You've got some moisture coming from the bottom, 

253
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,840
which is actually where the juices have soaked back in. 

254
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,160
But, you've also got moisture at the top, 

255
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,880
which is an indication that the pastry wasn't as good as we expected it to be. 

256
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,440
You know what I'm going to say, don't you? No soggy bottom. 

257
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,800
It needs more substance running through it. 

258
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,680
- There's not much about it.
- OK. 
- I think it's missing something. 

259
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,800
Underneath, you just look there, look... 

260
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,840
It's quite wet and soggy at the bottom as well. 

261
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,680
The interior is delicious. 

262
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,760
I've never had a quark pastry, 

263
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,720
and so this is really exciting. 

264
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,880
I think you've got a decent bake round the outside, 

265
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,440
you got a little bit of a crisp there. 

266
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,080
Looks very nice on the plate, when you serve it. 

267
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,200
And what lovely contrasting colours. 

268
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,440
Pastry is very interesting, and is a lovely flavour. Quite different. 

269
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,560
When we walked up to it, it was sort of Monarch of the Glen. 

270
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,360
- Lovely antlers.
- The top - there's not many layers in there. 

271
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,800
It's trying to be flaky. 

272
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,200
- Would you mind if I eat an antler? 
- Be my guest. 

273
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,720
- Great flavour.
- Is it? 

274
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,880
- It's delicious. But the pastry is just a bit...
- Too thin. 

275
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,160
You can see how thin it is, and therefore it can't flake. 

276
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,520
It's trying to, but it can't. 

277
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,560
Although, there's some great lamination on the antler. 

278
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,560
- Thanks, John.
- Thank you. 

279
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,840
Delicious. 

280
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,840
I think it looks great. The design of it looks great, the cuts... 

281
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,600
- Love the little fishy eyes, Ryan. 
- Thank you.
- Very sweet. 

282
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,760
Mm... It's a bit soggy right down the middle of that. 

283
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,120
You needed a little bit longer just to catch that bit there. 

284
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,600
It's got a great texture. It looks amazing inside. 

285
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,200
It does. Flavour is really good. 

286
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,280
You've used these very subtle spices. 

287
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,360
I think you've got a beautiful flavour of fish, well baked fish, 

288
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,040
the blend of the flavours is so subtle, 

289
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,880
- and I think you've got great layers in that pastry as well. Well done. 
- Thank you. 

290
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,160
I think it's quite coquettish. You know, it's saying, 

291
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,600
"Look at me, look what's inside. Come on in." 

292
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,800
I think it looks like the Alien film. 

293
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,960
SHE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY 

294
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,480
I think it's happened because you told us earlier on 

295
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,880
- you weren't going to chill your meat.
- Uh-huh, yeah. 

296
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,120
But because the whole thing would've been a bit warm, not stone cold, 

297
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,560
that's why it's had a little trickle down the side. 

298
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,840
- Yeah, that's completely... 
- I'm looking down the other side. 
- The pastry melted before it cooked. 

299
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,360
The flavours inside I've no problem with but I do have a problem with the bottom. 

300
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,920
It's... Well, it's raw. 

301
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,960
- OK...
- Ooh, hello! Look at that! 

302
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,720
That flake is lovely. 

303
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,680
- It's quite impressive, that, Cathryn.
- Thank you. 

304
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,280
What, essentially, you've done, is you've made a massive sausage roll. 

305
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,960
- Yeah, OK. I know.
- I think it's nice. 

306
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,600
But it is, it's a massive sausage roll. 

307
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,480
It's a lovely family Wellington. 

308
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,640
You have a young family and I can imagine this appealing to everybody. 

309
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,720
It's different from all the others 

310
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,400
- but for me, it's absolutely delicious.
- Mmm. 

311
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,400
I'm actually really shocked that they liked it as much as they did. 

312
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,480
'Pastry's not my big forte' 

313
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,080
but the lamb was perfect. Mary did love the lamb. 

314
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,240
SHEEP BLEATS 

315
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,160
I would say I don't think it could've gone much worse 

316
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,200
but I think it could've gone worse. 

317
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,040
Well...no. At the moment it couldn't have gone worse. 

318
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,560
Of the many pleasures of pie-eating, 

319
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,440
surely the most satisfying 

320
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,000
is that moment where you cut in through the crust 

321
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,080
and reveal the beautiful, succulent filling that lies within. 

322
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,440
But imagine if said filling was a slimy, elongated fish 

323
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,000
that had been hauled out of a polluted river. 

324
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,240
'London's East End market workers have long enjoyed cooking with eels. 

325
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,320
'Throughout the 19th century, freshwater eels were part of the staple diet of the working classes. 

326
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,160
'At the time of the Industrial Revolution, 

327
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,240
'when the East End of London was overcrowded, polluted 

328
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,720
'and desperately poor, eel pie became ideal Cockney grub.' 

329
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,680
Now, clearly, we've got one very large eel pond 

330
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,760
in the form of the Thames. 

331
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,360
Presumably, the Thames played a huge part in the whole eel industry? 

332
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,240
There was a huge tradition of eel-fishing in the Thames 

333
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,520
going back centuries, and by the early 19th century, 

334
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,000
when the river was beginning to get very polluted, 

335
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,440
eels are one of the few things that could survive. 

336
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,240
Ollie, why were eels so popular as a pie filling? 

337
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,080
In those days eels were very cheap. In the mid-19th century, 

338
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,000
you could buy five pieces for a ha'penny. 

339
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,320
They're also very nutritious, very high in fat, 

340
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,600
and added to the piecrust, that would be a rich, filling dish which would keep you going 

341
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,760
if you were a Victorian man or woman of work. 

342
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,120
So they were the kind of perfect East End food. 

343
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,240
Originally, they were sold by travelling street vendors. 

344
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,760
By the middle of the 19th century, there were 500 of those in London. 

345
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,160
They also sold live eels, if you can believe it, 

346
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,480
so they would have buckets of thrashing eels 

347
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,640
which people would grab their hands in and take home to cook for tea. 

348
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,880
'Pie and mash shops became a more sociable and hygienic environment 

349
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,080
'in which to consume pies. 

350
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,720
'They were often family-run 

351
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,160
'and became an integral part of the working-class community. 

352
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,960
'By the First World War there were hundreds of pie and mash shops 

353
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,560
'scattered around the East End of London.' 

354
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,560
One well-known family running pie and mash shops here in the East of London 

355
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,160
is the Goddard family, 

356
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,040
and their shops are still going strong to this day, 

357
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,280
proving that Cockney fare is still as popular as ever. 

358
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm going to go inside and get myself some eel pie. 

359
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,240
Cor, my blimeys, Guv, strike a light, stone the crows! 

360
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,120
So, Clive, what were the old pie and mash shops like? 

361
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:19,360
Very similar to the one we've got now but with marble table. 

362
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,200
And probably tiled walls. 

363
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,320
- Sawdust on the floor.
- Oh, really? 

364
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,680
- Why the sawdust? Cos of...
- Eel bone. 

365
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,080
- Now, you say eel bones...
- Yes. 

366
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,200
- How would those have made their way onto the floor?
- From there... 

367
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,760
HE SPITS 

368
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,680
- So, hence spit and sawdust?
- Yes. 

369
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,600
'With eels no longer thriving in the Thames and their prices soaring, 

370
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,240
'eels fell off the menus in the pie and mash shops 

371
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,880
'to be replaced by beef. 

372
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,040
'But Clive's resurrected a traditional eel pie recipe 

373
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,200
'with a rough puff-pastry top and short-crust base, 

374
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,440
'to give me a taste of this long-lost Cockney bake.' 

375
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,320
- Amazing. Thank you so much for making this.
- I hope you enjoy it. 

376
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,080
- I'm going in.
- Mind, there might be an odd bone here and there.
- OK. 

377
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,680
Aw... 

378
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,120
Mm.. 

379
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,560
I got quite a lot of eel in that one! It's quite rivery! 

380
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,440
- I thought it'd be more chewy. 
- It's a very delicate fish. 

381
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,600
Yes, it's a nice, soft fish. People don't realise that it is 

382
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,160
as delicate as it is. 

383
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,680
- Is that nice?
- Do you know, it is. 
- Oh, good!
- It is. 

384
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,880
I'm quite getting into this, actually. 

385
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,600
I might be an eel convert. 

386
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,120
Two challenges remaining. 

387
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,200
The bakers have no idea what kind of pie is about to hit them. 

388
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,040
Of course, now it's time for the Technical Challenge, and, as ever, this is judged blind. 

389
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,720
So, Paul, Mary, 

390
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,280
if you'd care to go into the puff-pastry-lined pagoda of passion, 

391
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,920
we shall see you later. 

392
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,400
For today's Technical Challenge, 

393
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,040
we would like you to make 

394
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,800
a hand-raised pie. 

395
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,520
And we'd like it chicken, bacon and apricot. 

396
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,840
This is made with a hot-water crust, 

397
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,800
which is the kind of pastry that basically defies 

398
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,680
ALL the rules of pastry-making. 

399
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,920
You've got two and a quarter hours to go, bakers. 

400
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,080
- All the very best of luck. 
- On your marks...
- Get set...
- Bake! 

401
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,560
'Hand-raising pies is a bit of a lost art. 

402
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:32,440
'The method all the bakers have been given will probably be unfamiliar. 

403
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,520
'As will the equipment.' 

404
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,600
This is particularly hard because they have to use a doilie 

405
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,720
rather than a mould to raise the hot-water crust pastry around the outside. 

406
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,360
The hardest thing they're going to encounter 

407
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,720
is actually getting the thickness of the sides of the doilie correct. 

408
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,600
If it's too thin, when they try to put the filling in, it'll crack. 

409
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,560
If it's too thick then it'll be difficult to eat. 

410
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,560
So you've got to get it just right. 

411
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,200
And one of the key thing is where they will go wrong 

412
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,880
is the releasing of the doilie. 

413
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,360
If they haven't oiled their doilie correctly it will get stuck. 

414
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,640
- Look at those layers, Mary. 
- Absolutely perfect, 

415
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,800
and the chicken is just done to perfection. 

416
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,360
And you've got a good pastry on the side, not too thick, not too thin. 

417
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,840
Good bit of jelly inside there which fills all the gaps, 

418
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,240
and you can see distinct layers of the bacon, chicken, apricot, 

419
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,680
bacon, chicken, apricot, 

420
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,640
with the lid that sits below the level of the sides. 

421
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,680
And that is the perfect hand-raised pie. 

422
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,120
I have never made...or... 

423
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,000
probably eaten a hand-raised pie but I've seen one. 

424
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,880
'Hot-water crust pastry lives up to its name, 

425
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,120
'made from hot water instead of cold. 

426
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,600
'It needs to be worked while warm.' 

427
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,240
I like making hot-water crust pastry because I'm quite hot-handed. 

428
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,720
'Two fats have to be melted together. 

429
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,200
'Butter for flavour and lard to give it its crisp texture.' 

430
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,200
Oh, lard! I hate the smell of lard. It stinks. 

431
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,360
'Once melted, 

432
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,200
'the fat is added to flour and salt to create smooth, shiny dough.' 

433
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,240
Interesting. 

434
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,840
Never done hot-water crust pastry, never done anything like this before. 

435
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,120
Never seen even some of the equipment. 

436
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,800
I don't know. I've never had dollies, believe it or not! 

437
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,320
Grease two medium-size pie dollies with some oil. 

438
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,440
Didn't know what a pie doilie was till right now. 

439
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,160
Guess this is it. 

440
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,040
'The doilie is an ancient method of shaping a pie case 

441
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,600
'without using a tin. 

442
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,280
'The doilie is then removed and the pie baked in the oven 

443
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,320
'so the sides of the pastry are directly exposed to the heat, 

444
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,680
'becoming crisp and water-tight. Perfect for holding jelly or gravy.' 

445
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,360
One pastry I'd never made and was worried about before applying for this whole competition 

446
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,240
was a hot-water crust, and so for my auditions 

447
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,680
I actually made an effort to make a hot-water crust pheasant pie. 

448
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,040
So... But I never used dollies. I had a tin. 

449
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,480
But the good thing is, one thing I learnt about hot-water crust 

450
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,440
is that it falls apart and then you just paste it back together. 

451
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,480
So it gives you confidence cos you've dealt with it once before. 

452
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,160
'The recipe contains no instructions for raising the dough.' 

453
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,840
Oh, dear. This is going to go really wrong. 

454
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,000
'To prevent the dough from sticking to the doilie, 

455
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,960
'they should rotate it while squeezing the pastry into shape.' 

456
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,120
I've never seen one of these before in my whole life. 

457
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,560
I don't know if this is right... 

458
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,480
..or not. 

459
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,720
I'm going to start again. 

460
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,840
Manisha, presumably this is your first time working with this? 

461
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,560
- Yeah. I'm not really aware... 
- Is it freaking you? 

462
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,840
- Yeah, because...
- Yeah?
- ..this could have chances of me going out. 

463
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,160
Don't know how to make puff pastry, don't know how to make this pastry. 

464
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,440
- Oh, come on!
- It's all about the pastry these days. 

465
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,840
Well...these days it is all about the pastry. 

466
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,400
OK, right... 

467
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,160
'The warm pastry must be chilled,

I'll be more comfortable when this goes in the oven. 

470
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,760
At the moment I'm not sure how that pastry will come out of the dollies, 

471
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,240
so a bit worried about that. 

472
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,880
'The chilled pastry must be handled delicately.' 

473
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,040
I don't know how to get these off. 

474
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,520
If I roll it down then I could perhaps roll it back up, but... 

475
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,600
This is not going to work. 

476
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,960
'The slightest tear will allow the filling to seep out, 

477
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,840
'ruining the pie's appearance.' 

478
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,360
Must be a technique. 

479
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,160
This can't be right. 

480
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,400
So far, we are all in exactly the same predicament. 

481
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,080
Nobody is able to get their pastry off of the dollies. 

482
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,600
Oh, look at that! It's just a disgrace from start to finish! 

483
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,760
Is knocking going to help? Knocking the doilie? 

484
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,520
Why use a stupid thing like this when you can use tins? 

485
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,160
We're not in the 1600s now, are we? Let's face it. 

486
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,600
SHE GASPS

(Yay! Still standing up!) 

489
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,000
Right. How did I do that just then? 

490
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,880
One hour to go, bakers!

00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,920
'of bacon, apricot and chicken.' 

494
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,560
This looks like something dreadful! 

495
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,920
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! 

496
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,560
'Crimping the pie lids prevents the filling from spilling out. 

497
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,040
'The small hole allows steam to escape in the oven and stops the crust becoming soggy.' 

498
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,840
I'm in a flap. 

499
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,480
Oh, yeah, I didn't eggwash. 

500
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,720
And I think that might be important, particularly for the colour, 

501
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,000
so I'm just literally going like this, really quick, 

502
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,480
pretending they've never been in the oven. 

503
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,120
OK, and they're going back in and no-one's any the wiser. 

504
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Except I've got a bit of scrambled egg on my baking tray. 

505
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,280
Done. 

506
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,320
And nobody knew! 

507
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,240
OK, bakers, ten minutes. It's just ten minutes left. 

508
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,320
Look at them, they're hideous. Absolutely hideous. 

509
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,720
Isn't this just the most horrible challenge you've ever done in your life? 

510
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,440
Yeah. They look awful. They look absolutely awful. 

511
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,560
'Paul's recipe demands that the pies are filled with a mixture of gelatine and stock. 

512
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,200
'If this jelly doesn't completely surround the meat inside 

513
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,720
'it will become dry as the pie cools.' 

514
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,640
Please do not leak! 

515
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,680
Stop dripping. 

516
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,160
This one's leaking like any person's business. 

517
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,360
It's going down and then out the bottom! 

518
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,160
SHE LAUGHS 

519
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,920
Ooh... 

520
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,240
Right, they'll never know. 

521
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,000
I'm completely out of my depth. I know that they look awful. 

522
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,960
Bakers, your time's up now. That was a very, very tough pie-riddled day for you all. 

523
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,720
We're actually going to ask you to leave them over night 

524
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,320
so that the jelly can set, 

525
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,800
and so Paul and Mary will judge them and taste them tomorrow morning. 

526
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,600
That technical challenge was a bit of a nightmare for me from start to finish, 

527
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,120
so it's not great that I've got to wait over night to find out my fate, really. 

528
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,720
It was a disaster, yeah. 

529
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,080
The pie was cooked. It looked a bit of a dog's dinner. 

530
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,720
But at least it's a pie to hand in. 

531
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,840
Tonight will be... I'm just going to have to forget about it tonight 

532
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,080
cos there's absolutely nothing I can do now. 

533
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,000
So I'll just have to try and keep that in the front of my mind 

534
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,840
and not obsess over it at two o'clock in the morning. 

535
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,640
After a restless night for the bakers, it's judgment time. 

536
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,280
Mary and Paul haven't seen the baking 

537
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,480
so have no idea which pie belongs to which baker. 

538
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,600
When you glance your eye down these pies, the doilie you'd not 

539
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,040
believe was the same size. 

540
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,560
This one is dropped. The pastry is soft and has ballooned out. 

541
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:56,600
There is no layers. It's just been thrown in. 

542
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,240
It's not a hand raised pie. 

543
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,360
- It's more like a pasty. 
- Flavour is good though. 

544
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,440
There has been some effort been made in this one 

545
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,880
but there's been no crimping at all. 

546
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,640
You needed to fold it in to give it that strength. 

547
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,240
- The filling is absolutely delicious. 
- It tastes good. 

548
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,360
It just looks a mess. 

549
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,920
I can't see any sign of jelly in that. See here? 

550
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,200
There's nothing. Very little in there. 

551
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,640
As long as the walls and the structure of your pie is strong 

552
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,800
and it just doesn't pour straight out the bottom which 

553
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,240
looking down here, it probably did on a few of them 

554
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,240
especially this one. 

555
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,200
- This has got a nice crimp on the outside.
- This is better. 

556
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,480
This is better. Good colour. Crimping isn't bad. 

557
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,400
- Got the layers right.
- The walls are pretty good as well. 

558
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:59,680
- Again where's the jelly? 
- This one has gone a bit lopsided. 

559
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:06,120
- The layers are good.
- Flavour's nice. Pastry a bit thick. 

560
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,000
Layers are good. Can't see the gelatine in there again. 

561
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,120
We haven't got any at all. Look. It's a crisp pastry though. 

562
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,120
The structure's not bad, but it's too fat. 

563
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,120
Look at the size of the doilie. It's got no resemblance 

564
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,480
to the size of the doilie. 

565
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,960
OK, last one. 

566
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,880
This is an improvement. 

567
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,840
Although the pastry wall very, very thick. 

568
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,960
And slightly underdone here. 

569
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,120
But whose hand-raised pie has risen above the rest? 

570
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:49,520
We're going to start from the last one which is here. 

571
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,080
It's a pasty. 

572
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,160
It's been packed and just splayed out. 

573
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,480
Seventh place was this one. 

574
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,800
The holes and everything that runs round that you obviously had 

575
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,080
serious problems with the pastry trying to build it up 

576
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,720
round the doilie and probably taking it off as well. 

577
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,560
- Number six is this one. 
- The lid, there's no crimping. 

578
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:16,400
It's just been dropped on from a height. In fifth place is this one. 

579
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,600
It's not bad. You got the layers in there 

580
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,280
and again it goes down to the colour and the structure of it. 

581
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,880
It's all collapsed and concertinaed in. 

582
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,280
With Sarah Jane fourth and Brendan third, the battle for top place 

583
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,360
is between Cathryn and John. 

584
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,400
Number two is this one. It does look like a raised pie. 

585
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,160
It's got lovely layers in it, pastry just a little too thick. 

586
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,680
Obviously first place is this one. 

587
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,680
Well done, Cathryn. 

588
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,720
APPLAUSE 

589
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,440
The layers are good, the colour is good, the crimping excellent. 

590
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,240
It looks the closest to mine. 

591
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,040
I'm really shocked, really happy and I can't wait to ring my family 

592
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,560
later and tell them. They won't believe it because I phoned them 

593
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,520
last night and said that was really horrible, horrible, 

594
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,640
technical challenge so they'll be really surprised. 

595
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:17,520
I could quite easily go out today. So could a few other people I think. 

596
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,040
If my next bake wasn't up to standard or wasn't that good, 

597
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,200
then definitely, you know, this girl's got to go out. 

598
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,560
It's come to a point where you can't be average any more. 

599
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,200
You've got to get your basics right and the pastry is a basic. 

600
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,720
It means a lot to me. I've worked so hard to get to this point. 

601
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,680
It's almost beyond baking now. It's not like life or death any more. 

602
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,000
It's about good bakes and bad bakes. That's it. 

603
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,920
Just one pie challenge remains for the bakers to prove they're 

604
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,640
worthy of staying in the bakeoff. 

605
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,120
If you take Cathryn and Brendan because I think they've done well 

606
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,160
and put them to one side, 

607
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,480
everybody else is in the danger zone. 

608
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,600
It's the technical challenge that really sorted them out. 

609
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,400
Ryan who I thought did really well, came last in the technical, 

610
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:11,360
therefore it automatically puts you up for leaving the show. 

611
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,680
We've now got the showstopper. It'll all rest on the showstopper. 

612
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,120
So, bakers, it's your showstopper challenge of course. 

613
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,760
And today we'd love you to make a sweet American pie. 

614
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,520
So we're looking for a family sized American pie. 

615
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,080
It's got no lid so you don't have to worry about that. 

616
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,000
Just the side and bottom and crust. You've got three and a half hours 

617
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,120
to bake it in. Best of luck, this is a big one. So, on your marks... 

618
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,160
- Get set...
- bake. 

619
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,840
The vast range of American pies were invented by European immigrants 

620
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,640
who brought pastry making techniques with them to America 

621
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,680
and took advantage of the local ingredients. 

622
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:59,040
What I'm hoping for is that some baker picks up the idea of a 

623
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,560
pumpkin pie, pecan pie, key lime pie and says you know what 

624
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,480
that's far too sweet. I'm going to lessen that sweetness and let 

625
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,480
the subtlety of flavours come through and give you that sense 

626
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,640
of wow, I'm going to have another piece of that, because to be honest, 

627
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,320
most of the American pies we've had before, I'd not go back 

628
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,640
for another one. 

629
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,520
Most of the bakers are making a sweet crust base which is 

630
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,640
a shortcrust pastry enriched with sugar. 

631
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,960
It's strong enough to hold fillings but delicate 

632
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,360
and has a rich buttery taste. 

633
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,000
I'm kind of in the danger zone at the moment 

634
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,760
and the really technical part of this dish is in the pastry 

635
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,840
and if I have problems with pastry, you know, that's it. 

636
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,280
I might be history. 

637
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,560
Ryan is pinning his hopes for survival on an American classic - 

638
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,720
key lime pie and adding an unusual twist. 

639
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,560
Ryan, what's different about your key lime pie? 

640
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,760
I've actually brought in the flavour of ginger which isn't 

641
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,360
traditional to a normal key lime pie. I put ginger with the lime. 

642
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,560
- It goes really well. 
- Your flavour combinations 

643
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,640
generally have been very good, however in the technical you got 

644
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,280
- a kick in the teeth but I'm looking forward to this.
- I think it's great. 

645
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,320
My brother lives in America so I got a few tips from him 

646
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:24,440
and he did say peanut butter was a goer so that's what I went with. 

647
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,640
Cathryn's hoping to continue her run of success with her peanut butter 

648
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:32,600
and squash pie filling packed into a chocolate short crust pastry. 

649
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,760
I'd love to be star baker. 

650
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,960
I'm reluctant to say it really 

651
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:43,200
but I really want it before I leave to have got star baker once. 

652
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,920
This could be terrible and then I've blown my chances, so. 

653
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,560
Half of my family are American 

654
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,640
and my childhood memory of pumpkin pie was it's disgusting. 

655
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:02,200
So I've actually decided to try and make a pumpkin pie that was going 

656
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,280
to be acceptable and palatable to my adult self. 

657
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,920
Danny is making a trick or treat pie with a chocolate short 

658
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,960
crust base lined with salted caramel and filled with roasted 

659
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,440
butternut squash, maple syrup and a generous splash of rum. 

660
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,000
One thing - Paul is notoriously abstemious 

661
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
- when it comes to alcohol in desserts.
- Yes. 

662
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,640
Puddings, pies etc. So you're in a difficult position now. 

663
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,640
Do you basically make it all booze to satisfy Mary's palate 

664
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,720
or do you ease off it for Paul? 

665
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,520
I'm using a spiced rum and I actually think this is 

666
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,720
quite rich and I think the rum just lifts it a bit. 

667
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,600
Because otherwise it's just cloyingly sweet. 

668
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,040
It's got all-American desserts to my taste 

669
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,880
and I say this as a child being fed them. 

670
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,960
For me, to make a good American pie you almost have to make it British 

671
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,000
but then technically it's got to come through right. 

672
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,560
I'll try, Paul, and we'll see what you have to say. 

673
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,160
The kids like this. My husband loves this, it's one of his favourites - 

674
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,320
banana, chocolate, rum and stuff. 

675
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,600
It's good. 

676
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,800
Sarah Jane's future in the bakeoff could rest on her chocolate 

677
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,600
and banana cream pie with salted rum caramel. 

678
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,680
The English don't do things like this do they? A bit embarrassed. 

679
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,720
You love this kind of stuff, but we'd be like, 

680
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,960
oh no, I'd rather just have an apple. I don't want a pie. 

681
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,160
I'm making a sweet potato pie 

682
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,160
and it's basically just sweet pastry and then a sweet potato filling 

683
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,440
made with two potatoes, eggs and condensed milk - all nice things. 

684
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,920
I really came up with the idea when I found some really old-fashioned 

685
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,760
videos online of this being made by these kind of grassroots 

686
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,080
southern American chefs and I'll was like, I need to try this. 

687
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,920
I'm rushing the pastry. I'm so short on time. 

688
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,040
And it's not chilling enough and it's falling apart. I mean. 

689
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,960
To prevent the pastry getting soggy the case is baked before adding 

690
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,520
the filling. 

691
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,880
The ceramic beans conduct the heat evenly ensuring a crisp 

692
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,520
and perfectly baked bottom. 

693
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,440
Damn it! 

694
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,360
In my rush I didn't put baking beans on. 

695
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,960
The sites of the tart collapsed. I don't know why. 

696
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,560
So I've to do a second batch obviously. Of course I'm panicking. 

697
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,240
I'm sorry, Brendan. 

698
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,760
Bakers, you've got one hour 

699
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,360
until bye bye, American pie. 

700
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,120
If that collapses on me again, I don't know what I'll do. 

701
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,520
There's no plan B. 

702
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,480
The bakers are using a variety of traditional American ingredients. 

703
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,520
None have opted to make the most famous of all American pies 

704
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,680
the humble apple pie. 

705
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,360
This ironically blossomed from the fussy eating 

706
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:30,920
habits of the first British settlers in the early 1600s. 

707
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,400
When the English colonists arrived in the New World they find 

708
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,440
a variety of fruit and vegetables with which they were very unfamiliar. 

709
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,720
Of course they didn't trust the local population either. 

710
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,560
This distrust led many of them not to use the local ingredients 

711
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,520
and in fact in some colonies they even starved to death. 

712
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,040
One solution the colonists found was to bring over fruit 

713
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,440
and vegetables with which they were familiar, particularly apple. 

714
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,360
So they brought apple seeds all the way from the old world to 

715
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,120
America and planted orchards. 

716
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,800
These orchards became vital to the colonists survival and in 

717
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,000
the 1640s they were written into law with the state of Virginia 

718
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,080
insisting that all landholdings above a certain size 

719
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,800
- include an apple orchard. 
- Soon apple orchards were spreading 

720
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,280
right across the United States and were helped by early pioneers 

721
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,440
such as Johnny Appleseed. From 1775 onwards he crisscrossed 

722
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,320
the United States taking apple seed from cider presses 

723
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,120
and scattering them all over the country. 

724
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,760
It took ten years before the first orchards bore fruit 

725
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,000
but when they did one of the first ways in which the colonists 

726
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,960
celebrated their bountiful harvest was by baking apple pies. 

727
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,120
You have the first apple harvest after ten years and it's wonderful 

728
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,480
because it's a sign that they've established themselves, 

729
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,040
the nation is growing the same way the fruit trees are growing, 

730
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,560
they do the harvest, it's a fantastic triumph 

731
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,520
and the ultimate thing they can do to celebrate is to make apple pies 

732
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,040
because it was the only thing you could really make in these 

733
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,640
really primitive ovens and kettles they had. Not cakes, pies. 

734
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,200
The apple pie was fast becoming the iconic American dish and it 

735
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,520
didn't remain the preserve of the British settlers for long, but was 

736
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,840
adapted to suit the vast array of culinary tastes that formed America. 

737
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:18,120
Each wave of people that came added their own influences. 

738
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,640
So in the area where you've a lot of German or Pennsylvania Dutch 

739
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,720
people coming in they had a very Germanic sour cream pie. 

740
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,520
And as the apple moves into the Midwest, 

741
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,200
you've the Scandinavian version which is an apple pie 

742
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,520
but it's open and has a crunchy crust with chopped walnuts 

743
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,200
and lots of cinnamon, but it's still an apple pie. 

744
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,520
These pies from that moment became the image of America the nation, 

745
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,080
self-sufficiency, colonial beginnings and most of all, 

746
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,880
mom, because it was a sign of motherhood to be able to make 

747
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,280
a good pie and that's why in World War II 

748
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,560
they asked the American troops what are you fighting for? 

749
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,440
They said we're fighting for mom and apple pie in the same way 

750
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,600
that the English would say they're fighting for God and country. 

751
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,680
The apple pie might have begun its American journey as a result 

752
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,640
of the British settlers unwillingness to try new things 

753
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,480
but it's gone on to symbolise the optimistic resourceful 

754
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,520
and pioneering spirit that has built America. 

755
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,040
It looks OK. 

756
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,200
With the pastry cases out of the oven, the bakers 

757
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,080
concentrate on their fillings. 

758
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,520
Manisha's pureeing bananas with butterscotch sauce, whipped cream 

759
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,080
and egg whites for her banana scotch pie, topped off with meringue. 

760
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,720
What is going to set it? Have you got egg in it? 

761
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,440
- Yeah, egg white.
- Egg white. 

762
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,640
I'm going to whisk the egg white until it's firm-peaked, 

763
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,480
fold it, put the banana in the double cream that's whipped, 

764
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,360
and then fold that creamed banana within the egg whites. 

765
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,000
And are you going to bake that? 

766
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,440
No, then it's going to go onto the baked pastry 

767
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,120
and it's going to set in the fridge. 

768
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,400
Right. 

769
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,600
I don't know how she's going to set her pie. 

770
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,160
When we have the pies presented in front of us, 

771
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,240
we've got to get a beautiful cut piece out of it 

772
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:25,760
and that is the skill, not only getting all the flavours right, 

773
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,120
the crispy pastry and everything else, 

774
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,040
it's getting, when you cut into it, 

775
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,800
- every single slice looks beautiful on the plate.
- Sits up and begs. 

776
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,200
All the pies should have a firm consistency 

777
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,840
to create the perfect slice. 

778
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,280
It will be big, it will be special occasion, Thanksgiving-like, 

779
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,840
and it captures the colours of America. 

780
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,360
Brendan's using layers of blueberries, raspberries 

781
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,120
and Chantilly cream in his pie 

782
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,240
to represent the red, white and blue 

783
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,560
of the American flag. 

784
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,920
His pie won't be baked again, so he's using pectin in the blueberries 

785
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,200
and gelatine in the raspberry chiffon, 

786
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,560
a layer of strained raspberries mixed with cream, 

787
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,880
to set the filling. 

788
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,120
It's just enough that it slices and holds its shape. 

789
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,760
Ryan's using a natural reaction between condensed milk 

790
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,680
and acidic lime juice to thicken his pie filling, 

791
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,520
which is then baked in the oven. 

792
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,000
OK, which way round is it? 

793
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,280
Dish, dish, dish, yep. 

794
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,600
Um... Idiot. 

795
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,680
Probably use that one. Don't worry. 

796
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,480
Now watch it, it might splash. 

797
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,600
John is pulling out all the stops 

798
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,080
with his star-spangled pecan pie 

799
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,240
with sour cherries and chocolate ganache 

800
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,680
in a sweet crust pastry. 

801
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,800
I don't know, I do always feel under pressure in this tent, you know, 

802
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,640
because no matter how good you do in one round, 

803
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:55,240
the next round could go bottoms up, so... 

804
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,040
I feel under immense pressure. 

805
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,240
OK, bakers, you've got 30 minutes left on your pie clocks. 

806
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,400
30 minutes, please. 

807
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,720
Ryan's making an Italian meringue for his topping, 

808
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,880
adding cooked sugar syrup into whipped egg whites. 

809
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,360
Right, so I'm taking a risk because I was such rushed for time, 

810
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,040
I whipped the egg white before I left it in the fridge. 

811
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,320
Hopefully, it won't slow me up. 

812
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,080
I'm re-whipping it again, this time in a sugar syrup 

813
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,960
and I'm just hoping it'll hold. 

814
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,600
The beaten egg whites trap hundreds of bubbles, creating volume, 

815
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,680
but if overbeaten or left too long, 

816
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,480
the bubbles burst and the egg white turns to liquid. 

817
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,760
Oh, my goodness! Look at that! 

818
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,760
Definitely out this week, people. 

819
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,320
- What am I supposed to do?
- Caramel. 

820
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,880
- Oh!
- Caramel, Manisha? 

821
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,280
Sugar. I'm going to try and patch it on with sugar. 

822
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,440
If the pastry tastes good, then I stand a chance of surviving. 

823
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,360
If not, then I'm in danger. 

824
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,280
Can you believe this? I don't think I can handle the pressure, you know. 

825
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,880
Yee-ha! You be gettin' them pies ready in five minutes! 

826
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,680
I don't know why I'm speaking Norwegian. 

827
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,360
Shaking like a... 

828
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,640
leaf. 

829
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,280
How's it going, Manisha? 

830
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,080
As you can see, not good. 

831
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,360
It is dripping. 

832
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,400
I should actually just leave it. That does not look right. 

833
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,960
There's a bit of a gap here, isn't there? 

834
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,160
Is there something you can shore it up with? 

835
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,920
Shall I do it with lots of meringue? 

836
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,200
Is the meringue going to stop that from oozing out, 

837
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,640
- do you think?
- Hopefully.
- Yeah. 

838
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,400
OK, bakers, that's the end of the bake. Move your pies 

839
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,680
to the end of the benches. Thank you and God bless America. 

840
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,920
HE GASPS, SIGHS 

841
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,920
For one of these bakers, 

842
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,320
this will be the last time they'll face the judges. 

843
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,320
Brendan, please bring your pie up. 

844
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,800
It's quite an elegant-looking pie. 

845
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,520
Pastry's nice and thin around the side. It looks crispy. 

846
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,200
It's held quite well. 

847
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,600
- It's well baked. 
- Really well baked.
- Oh, good. 

848
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,400
Sharp. Sweet. Flavour's coming through. 

849
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,760
Well thought out. 

850
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,240
Great base. 

851
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,840
John. Please bring us your pie. 

852
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,080
Oh, lovely! 

853
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,720
SUE SMACKS HER LIPS 

854
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,280
- There's a lot going on in there, isn't there?
- Yeah, 

855
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,120
there is, but that's America for you. 

856
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,040
I think it's very, very interesting. 

857
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,320
I'm not mad on these cherries. 

858
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,280
I think it's a nice idea. It's well executed. 

859
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,680
I think you had a bit of a problem with the sleeve itself 

860
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,200
but I don't think it's a bad thing, you've done quite well. 

861
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,120
Good piping work. 

862
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,720
A little bit of weeping with the caramel 

863
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,600
coming just over the top. You've been too generous with it. 

864
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,480
I think the pastry looks quite thin. 

865
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,960
I like that cos it's not overpowering. 

866
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,560
Everything goes with it and it's not too sweet. 

867
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,160
- Overall, it's a nice pie. 
- I'm pleased.
- Well done.
- Thank you! 

868
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,320
This way. 

869
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,720
Wheel of Fortune. 

870
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,880
It doesn't look very appetising, if I'm going to be honest. 

871
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,320
- Mmm.
- I really rather like it. 

872
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,960
It's unusual. The spice is coming through. 

873
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,200
The pecan's sitting well underneath. Good, crispy base. 

874
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,400
It's very interesting. 

875
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,720
Is that a showstopper? 

876
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,560
Has it quite got the wow factor when you look at it? 

877
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,200
Manisha. 

878
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,360
I mean, obviously, you've had issues with it. 

879
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,440
- Yes.
- OK, let's have a look inside the texture. 

880
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,400
(That's a big mess.) 

881
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,040
- Yeah, but it is.
- Right. 

882
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,800
Your pastry is good. 

883
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,000
Your pastry's crisp. After that... 

884
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,560
- It's all downhill.
- Yeah. 

885
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,480
You know what's wrong with it? What started at the beginning, 

886
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,480
you have no setting agent in the whole thing. 

887
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,120
There's nothing in there to set that off, 

888
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,400
to build your layers up 

889
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,720
and you had banana mousse, meringue, the caramel. 

890
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,200
It's never going to set in a million years. 

891
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,840
Danny, please bring your pie up for inspection. 

892
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,760
- It's held up well.
- Mmm. 

893
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:26,360
- It's baked well underneath. 
- MEL: Smells good. 

894
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,840
- Um, the alcohol...
- Yeah. 

895
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,560
- Really strong.
- Right.
- Um... 

896
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,680
The pastry's good. The texture of the filling is good. 

897
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,320
The flavour's all right as well, 

898
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,640
it's the alcohol, it's the only thing that's lingering in my mouth. 

899
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,960
- It is. It's very strong. 
- OK, thank you very much. 

900
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,920
- I take your point. - Very tasty, though. 

901
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,840
Cathryn, if you'd like to bring your American pie up. 

902
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,400
- Mmm!
- Wow! 

903
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,800
- I like the simplicity of the whole thing.
- That cuts beautifully. 

904
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,000
- The slice comes out well. 
- Thank you. 

905
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,680
- I don't like that. 
- Don't you?
- At all. 

906
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:16,040
It's like eating a pot full of crunchy peanut butter. 

907
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,560
- But with none of the flavour.
- Oh. 

908
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,800
I think you've made something 

909
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,720
that looks wonderful, terribly tempting to eat, but... 

910
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,000
- But then tastes disgusting? 
- The taste is not very appealing. 

911
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,480
Ryan, you're up next. 

912
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,200
- I think it looks absolutely lovely. So fresh.
- Thank you. 

913
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,680
To have it, instantly you know 

914
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,120
that is key lime pie 

915
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,280
because you've got the little pieces of lime. 

916
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:00,320
- You nailed that one, Ryan.
- Thank you.
- You've absolutely nailed that. 

917
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,920
The flavour of that lime coming through 

918
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:06,720
and you get that crystallised ginger as well. That is very special. 

919
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,080
- Thank you.
- That's a very nice pie. 

920
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,720
- Sheer perfection.
- Oh, thank you. 

921
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,200
That's fantastic, mate. 

922
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:18,880
I really want to stay, so having a good bake for a showstopper, 

923
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,840
you know, gets me to next weekend, so it's always good. 

924
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,640
MANISHA: That pie did look horrendous. 

925
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,440
There was nothing else I was expecting for them to say. 

926
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,480
"Oh, it looks beautiful." "Does it?" "No." 

927
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,440
You know, it didn't hold up, so...yeah. 

928
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:39,680
The main quote that's sticking with me is, "It tastes awful." 

929
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,640
Hero to zero. That's me. 

930
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,040
Having sampled a slice of every pie, 

931
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,200
it's up to Mary and Paul to decide who has truly excelled 

932
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,280
and whose journey has come to an end. 

933
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,560
- When you look at Cathryn's here at the moment...
- Who was a contender. 

934
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,720
Before she came into today, she was that far from getting Star Baker. 

935
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,920
I'm sorry. It wasn't good. 

936
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,480
I think Brendan's had a great weekend again. 

937
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,240
I mean, that tartness coming from the blueberries, 

938
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,080
then the sweetness coming from the chiffon was delicious. 

939
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,720
- He was the only person to use gelatine.
- Yeah. 

940
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,920
His attention to detail, his knowledge, 

941
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,560
as Bake Off goes on, he is getting stronger. 

942
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,840
I'm getting a smell of lime from this lovely piece of pie here 

943
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,520
which is of course Ryan's. 

944
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,320
I thought it was absolutely outstanding 

945
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:29,520
and it tasted way above all the others. 

946
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,920
This, I mean... 

947
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,040
- Technically, technical challenge... 
- He was last.
- Last place. 

948
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,760
Now, this breaks most of the rules that we'd set, but actually, 

949
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,040
that is good enough on its own to put him through to Star Baker. 

950
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,480
So we started off today pre-showstopper 

951
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,040
with six people being in trouble 

952
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,960
and potentially up for consideration to leave the show. 

953
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,240
Where do you think we stand after the big pie challenge? 

954
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,640
For the ones that need to go - 

955
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,400
Sarah-Jane could be in the ones to go 

956
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,840
because I didn't think... I mean, it tasted OK 

957
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,400
but having said that, I'd have to throw Manisha in there 

958
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,680
because that was a disaster. 

959
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,240
- Can I throw somebody else in as well?
- Yes. 

960
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,200
Danny. The alcohol in that was far too much. 

961
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,920
It wrecked what was actually, technically not a bad pie. 

962
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,400
- Yes.
- To recap, we've got three in the danger zone - 

963
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,400
Sarah-Jane, Danny and Manisha 

964
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,520
- and two for consideration for Star Baker.
- Ryan and Brendan.
- Yes. 

965
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:45,080
There's been much deliberation about this week's Star Baker 

966
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,240
and I have to say, it's a first. 

967
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,280
It began with something fishy. 

968
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,560
In the middle was a pasty-like substance 

969
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,400
but it ended on a high. 

970
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,960
In fact, this pie was so good that Paul and Mary 

971
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:02,160
wanted Ryan to know it was one of the best things they have tasted 

972
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,760
in all three series of The Bake Off. 

973
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,000
- Congratulations, Ryan.
- Well done, Ryan!
- You're our Star Baker. 

974
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,760
Oh, my goodness! 

975
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,720
- Thank you.
- Well done. 

976
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:15,120
But sadly, one of you, 

977
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:20,240
this is where your Bake Off experience ends, I'm afraid to say. 

978
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,760
And the person that we're going to say goodbye to this week is... 

979
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,680
..Manisha. 

980
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,520
- We're going to miss you. 
- We are going to miss you. 

981
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,520
Come and have a Mel/Sue sandwich. Whether you like it or not! 

982
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,520
'Manisha struggled. We're halfway through now.' 

983
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,600
Things are only going to get harder from now. 

984
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,720
I think she'd find it quite painful as we go on. 

985
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,200
The technical challenges are going to get even harder 

986
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,840
and I think she'd really struggle. 

987
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,040
My family, if I tell them that I'm out, 

988
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,720
they'll be all right with it because obviously... 

989
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:00,080
I don't know, they'll be all right with it, I think. 

990
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,320
They'll be a bit dis... I don't know if they'll be disappointed or not 

991
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,120
but I hope they're not, you know. 

992
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,240
That's the only thing I don't want to do, is disappoint people. 

993
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,400
'But yeah, it's been good.' 

994
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,480
This whole Bake Off has definitely given me good confidence, you know, 

995
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,680
that I can do things. Even if they mess up, I can still do them. 

996
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,920
I feel a bit battered by this one, actually. 

997
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,760
I think I've scraped through. 

998
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,600
I live to bake another week! Yay! 

999
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,280
'I think what means to me more than anything else' 

1000
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,040
is when they said this was one of the best bakes they'd had in a Bake Off. 

1001
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,200
and didn't realise it was that good 

1002
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,120
so yes, it took me by surprise. 

1003
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:43,280
Very lifted because the standard's been so high 

1004
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,960
and I think I might go home and make that key lime pie. 

1005
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,440
Next week... 

1006
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:52,480
I feel a bit panicky already, which is not a good way to start. 

1007
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,880
Rrgh! Stress! 

1008
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,040
- Why am I stressed? It's just baking. 
- 'It's time for pudding.' 

1009
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,680
Ooh, look at those! 

1010
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,840
'With a double signature sponge bake...' 

1011
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,920
The judges are making the challenges harder and harder. 

1012
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,120
Oh! Oh, no! 

1013
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:11,360
A royal technical challenge from the queen of baking... 

1014
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:15,280
- "Make the jam." That's detailed, Mary(!)
- I hate it when this happens. 

1015
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,560
Every single week in technical challenge, it's a guessing game. 

1016
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,600
A strudel challenge that will stretch them to the limit. 

1017
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,440
So far that you can... 

1018
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,480
But whose showstopper will stop everything? 

1019
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,600
Then that spike... 

1020
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,520
There was a lot of blood. It was grim. 

1021
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,360
