00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Welcome back to Somerset, where, last week, 

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,360
we single-handedly ploughed our way through a mountain of doughnuts 

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,280
and saw tighter buns than the Eurovision Song Contest. 

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,000
Two of their contemporaries went, 

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,760
this week, five bakers face the quarterfinals. 

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,200
And they face some of the biggest challenges we've ever seen. 

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,200
As always with the Bake Off, expect the unexpected. 

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,760
Scream if you want to go faster. 

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,040
We are on the roller coaster of baking, 

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,440
otherwise known as the Great British Bake Off. 

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,960
Last week: 

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,160
Oh! 

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,880
Sweet dough stood between the bakers and the quarterfinals. 

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,160
Psyching myself up. 

15
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,120
Cathryn was technically challenged. 

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,720
Doughnut doom. 

17
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,880
- Brendan and James were technically brilliant.
- Yes! 

18
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,880
- John wobbled. 
- What's wrong with them? 

19
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,000
And Danny finally became Star Baker. 

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,160
That was amazing, actually. 

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,600
But Ryan and Sarah Jane... 

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,240
- It's raw.
- Raw?
- Yeah. 
- ..baked their final buns. 

23
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,800
You have to win now, seriously. 

24
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,000
'Tonight... 

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,840
I've burnt my first batch. 

26
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,880
'It's the quarterfinals.' 

27
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,680
- Oh, law. I don't know what to do. 
- What the heck? 

28
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,240
'..with the largest number of Signature Bakes ever assembled.' 

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,280
I can't count! 

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,640
The hottest technical challenge... 

31
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,920
It's 35 degrees in here. 

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,000
- Oh, dear. 
- ..Ever attempted. 

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,120
I'm going to wait to right at the last minute. 

34
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,280
The biggest showstoppers ever constructed. 

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,000
This is like Meccano for boys with baking. 

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,640
And someone's Bake Off is about to fall apart. 

37
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,640
Total disaster. 

38
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,720
- It's crunch time. 
- Are they going to snap? 

39
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,840
- They're feeling brittle. 
- Phew... Will they crumble? 

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,600
It's biscuit week! 

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,240
Two days. 

42
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,080
Three challenges. 

43
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,240
And just four of these five remaining bakers 

44
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,400
can go through to the semi-finals. 

45
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,840
Famous five, welcome. 

46
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,280
I know the pressure's building, 

47
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,240
so we'll crack on with the Signature Bake this morning. 

48
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,800
And "crack" is the operative word because 

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,960
we're going to ask you today to make, please, 

50
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,680
48 crackers or crispbreads. 

51
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,160
You can use any flour you want, they can be leavened or unleavened. 

52
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,880
But the most important thing is they should be thin 

53
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,320
and crack when snapped in two. 

54
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,520
- Little bit like Nicole Kidman.
- Yeah. 

55
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,000
You've got two hours for this challenge. 

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,440
- On your marks.
- Get set.
- Bake! 

57
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,280
This is a gruelling test of consistency. 

58
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,520
Delivering a huge batch of perfectly baked crispbreads and crackers 

59
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,560
demands impressive organisation 

60
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,760
and incredible attention to the smallest of details. 

61
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,000
It's very, very difficult to get savoury crispbreads evenly baked, 

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,600
because they're so wafer-thin, they catch at the edges. 

63
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,800
We want every single one to be crisp all the way up 

64
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,680
and, when we turn them over, evenly baked. 

65
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,600
It's all about the bake on this. That, and the crispiness. 

66
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,680
I will be testing for the snap on every single one of them. 

67
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,360
Let's hope Mary and Paul like them. 

68
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,920
Most crackers start with a simple mix of flour, water and fat 

69
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,440
to make a basic dough. 

70
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,160
It's not often you make crackers unless there's a gathering or buffet or something, 

71
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,560
which is why it's interesting as a challenge, really. 

72
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,440
Crackers can be unleavened or leavened, they don't depend on a rise. 

73
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,080
James is using yeast, he's a real keen bread maker. 

74
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,880
I've not put yeast in it as I want them to be really crisp. 

75
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,920
But perhaps mine are going to be too dry. 

76
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,960
You just don't know what they're looking for. 

77
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,240
Yeast creates masses of tiny bubbles in the dough 

78
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,800
which gives a lighter texture, 

79
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,200
but makes it very difficult to get a thin, crispy result. 

80
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,000
First thing is quickly making the dough. 

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,640
These have got to prove, so I need, actually, as much time as possible. 

82
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,120
Two hours isn't that long. 

83
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,200
James' smoky cayenne, cumin and chilli crackers 

84
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,520
have an unconventional base ingredient. 

85
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,440
You're using a yeasted dough? 

86
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,480
- Yeasted polenta dough, yes. 
- Interesting. 

87
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,160
You've got to get that very thin. 

88
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,400
I baked it a couple of days ago. Teeth are just like steel. 

89
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,880
It's very spicy. 

90
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,760
You've got cumin and coriander and a chilli that, I don't know... 

91
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,880
- Chipotle, yes.
- Chipotle. 

92
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,040
Fantastic taste. I love it. 

93
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,360
Quite spicy. Hope you like things spicy. 

94
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,680
Let's just hope you get that thinness that you need. 

95
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Thinness. I'll make it extra thin for you. 

96
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,840
James isn't the only baker taking a chance with yeast. 

97
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,160
I've made them a lot this week. 

98
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,560
They don't always work perfectly, but they always taste nice. 

99
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,400
Cathryn has based her signature crispbreads 

100
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,120
on the classic British ploughman's lunch. 

101
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,240
I'm doing local Sussex cheese and pickle. 

102
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,840
- OK. Can I try a bit? 
- Yeah, of course. 

103
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,120
It's a bit like Cheshire. 

104
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,280
Cross between Cheshire and Cheddar. Very crumbly. 

105
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,840
It's a very full flavour. 

106
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,360
I'm going to roll them as thin as I can, 

107
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,360
then stretch each one individually before I put it on the baking tray. 

108
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,560
- If they're thin enough, they will snap.
- Cathryn, they've got to be. 

109
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Cos otherwise it'll be like a cookie. 

110
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,760
No, it won't be a cookie, it'll be a cracker. 

111
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,360
Flavouring a delicate cracker dough is risky. 

112
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,560
I've just added the chipotle and the cayenne. 

113
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,160
No idea what effect they might have on the yeast, 

114
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,120
but I just decided to add them halfway though. 

115
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,880
Acids and some proteins present in cheese or spices 

116
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,240
can retard yeast and affect a leavened cracker's structure when baked. 

117
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,840
For dried spice, a lot of the flavour is fairly redundant in it until it's cooked. 

118
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,040
So I want to just toast them off first, 

119
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,400
because that releases the essential oils in the spices 

120
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,840
and that gets the flavour really booming. 

121
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,240
But adding flavour at this early stage 

122
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,360
is the only way to ensure it's even across the whole batch. 

123
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,920
- HE SINGS 
- # Can you do this to me? # 

124
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,920
John's spicy Asian-inspired crackers are made without yeast 

125
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,120
and are flavoured with cumin, coriander and fennel. 

126
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,520
90 grammes. 

127
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,720
He's melting butter in water, before adding it to his dough mix 

128
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,040
so that, like his spices, it's distributed as evenly as possible. 

129
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,920
These are the crackers you'd have with your mates around. 

130
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,000
A really good nibbley cracker, packed full of flavour, 

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,440
which is what the judges were missing last week in my food. 

132
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,160
So, hopefully, this'll sort them out. 

133
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,840
I'm making a spicy almond cracker. 

134
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,520
It's a biscuit dough, where you're pulsing the butter into the flour. 

135
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,360
Then I'm using yoghurt to bind it together. 

136
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,200
The downside is I eat them as they come out. 

137
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,920
Today, there's meant to be a batch of 48. 

138
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,440
When I've made these at home before, I'm lucky if 20 make it to the tin. 

139
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,000
Danny's unleavened crackers 

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,080
are flavoured with a blend of North African spices called ras el hanout, 

141
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,280
as well as chopped almonds. 

142
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,400
Her dough has a controversial ingredient. 

143
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,960
I've taken a leaf out of Brendan's book, 

144
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,640
cos we're back to the '70s of desiccated cheese. 

145
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,800
I know you look horrified. 

146
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,240
- That's Parmesan?
- It is. 

147
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,520
- But proper Parmesan doesn't work. 
- Shaky, shaky Parmesan?
- Yeah. 

148
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,560
That's percussion, that's not edible! 

149
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,520
I've done it so many times I've tried it with fresh Parmesan. 

150
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,480
If you didn't want it to snap, I'd put fresh Parmesan on, 

151
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,240
- There's too much moisture in fresh Parmesan.
- It's your choice. 

152
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,160
- Great.
- Thanks very much, good luck. 
- Look forward to it. 

153
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,120
Bakers, you are halfway through the crispbread challenge. 

154
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,680
Are we? 

155
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,920
You've got one hour to go, I hope you're cracking on. 

156
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,480
Once their dough is rested, 

157
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,440
the bakers face a crucial decision when rolling it out. 

158
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,960
Oh, it's getting hot! 

159
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,080
Too thick, and their crackers won't snap. 

160
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,240
I'm just rolling these crackers out between two pieces of parchment paper. 

161
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,760
It's just the easiest way for me to get them as thin as I possibly can. 

162
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,760
Too thin, and the edges will burn before they're properly baked. 

163
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,400
Just pricking the cracker all over before I cut it, 

164
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,480
so that, when it's in the oven, it doesn't puff up. 

165
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,880
I'm expecting a few little bubbles here and there, 

166
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,840
but I don't want it to be like a big flying saucer, for example. 

167
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,800
What this allows you to do is test the thickness is even. 

168
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,320
When you prick it, 

169
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,240
you can feel whether it's thicker in one part than it is in another. 

170
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,960
Like Woody Woodpecker! 

171
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,120
HE IMITATES WOODY'S CALL 

172
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,800
Not only should every single cracker be the same thickness. 

173
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,200
10, 11... 

174
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,720
All 48 must also be exactly the same shape. 

175
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,480
I bring precision to everything I do. 

176
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,080
Equally with my gardening. 

177
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,080
If it's worth doing, it's worth doing well, to get the finish right. 

178
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,920
Brendan's crackers are packed with sesame, pumpkin and flax seeds 

179
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,240
and topped with a sprinkling of aniseed. 

180
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,320
I think you're rather clever to have done this on an oiled table. 

181
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,680
That means you can get it off, 

182
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,320
and you don't get that extra flour added all the time. 

183
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,800
The challenge for me is, because they're so thin, it's getting the bake right. 

184
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
The challenge is getting them off there! 

185
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,960
Even with the palette knife, you're going to distort that diamond a bit as well. 

186
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,920
Using one oven to bake 48 crackers perfectly... 

187
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,520
Um, I should be all right if I just pull my finger out 

188
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,560
and roll them a bit quicker than I have been. 

189
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,600
..requires careful planning. 

190
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,160
And intense concentration. 

191
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,000
The consistency is key and, because we're doing 48, 

192
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,960
it's going to be tricky to make sure every single one is the same. 

193
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,880
Crackers can bake in as little as four minutes. 

194
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,560
There's a really fine line between being cooked and crispy, or burnt. 

195
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,560
The baking temperature must be constant... 

196
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,680
Whoa! 

197
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,560
..to ensure every cracker is crisp. 

198
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,120
Which means using the same shelf 

199
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,680
for multiple batches. 

200
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,400
OK, there's 30 minutes left, bakers! Don't snap under the pressure. 

201
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,720
But one baker has decided to take a short cut. 

202
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,080
Might just chuck in a few more, just to see what they taste like. 

203
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,960
Cos I can't really taste any of these, cos I made exactly on 48. 

204
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,120
So, it's a bit annoying. 

205
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,400
James has made his crackers in one batch, and on different shelves. 

206
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,720
My perfect cracker would be this one. 

207
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,440
Just toasted. 

208
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,400
That one. 

209
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,280
Very thin, even thinner, but over-baked. 

210
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,400
Ones like that are a bit wonky. That's quite nice. 

211
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,960
Looks like a little mouse. 

212
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,680
I've burned the batch. 

213
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,040
I'm checking how far they've reached in their browning. 

214
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,160
I'm going to turn the oven off and leave it for ten minutes 

215
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,680
and the residual heat to complete the browning. 

216
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,320
Ohhh! 

217
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,880
Because, I suppose, the bake is short, 

218
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,960
there's not that kind of terror of, 

219
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,800
- will it prove or will it rise?
- I'm feeling a little bit of terror now. 

220
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,080
- Are you?
- Yes. A little bit. 

221
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,720
- Don't be scared of the crackerbreads. 
- Oh, my gosh, 

222
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,960
I've got others in the oven that are going to be burnt! 

223
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,760
Oh! Don't worry, that's all right. 

224
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,360
They're only a little bit burnt. 

225
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,080
Heavens to Betsy. What am I doing? 

226
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,040
Five minutes left, bakers. 48 crackers. Here we go. 

227
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,040
HE SIGHS HEAVILY 

228
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,880
One, two, three, four, five. 

229
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,880
It's too hot. 

230
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,640
I've got another 16 to go. 

231
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,520
Checking these. 

232
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,760
Just got my last batch in. 

233
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,240
Honestly, I've completely lost it. 

234
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,720
This is car crash crackers. 

235
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,360
I think I've just done enough. I haven't counted actually. 

236
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,680
Four, eight. 

237
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,120
12. 

238
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,760
- HE SINGS 
- # A cracker in the morning. # 

239
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,880
Three, four, five, 

240
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,000
six, seven, eight, nine, ten. 

241
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,240
Bakers, that is it. Cracker time is now up. 

242
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,400
I hope I've got that right. 

243
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,480
I've got 40... 

244
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,640
Danny, back away from the crackers. 

245
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,880
I'm not touching them. I can't count. 

246
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,360
It's judgement time. 

247
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,560
Brendan. Diamonds are trumps. 

248
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,000
They certainly look the part. They're beautifully even, 

249
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,360
but it's all in the tasting. 

250
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,600
BISCUIT SNAPS 

251
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,640
Nice break. 

252
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,240
< BRENDAN: Good. 

253
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,040
It's got a great bake on it. They're all equal. 

254
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,440
It adds a lot of texture to the cracker itself, the seeds. 

255
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,960
The seasoning for me is just right. Really scrummy. 

256
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,680
Do the Hollywood crack. 

257
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,000
BISCUIT SNAPS 

258
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,240
Good. 

259
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,520
BISCUIT SNAPS 

260
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,920
Yeah, good. 

261
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,440
What an interesting colour, so inviting. 

262
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,640
You've got a good consistency as well. 

263
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,160
Good consistency amongst the whole batch. 

264
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,760
You eat it first and you think, that's a bit bland, 

265
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,520
maybe a little bit salty. 

266
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,960
But when you get into it, you have a very fiery flavour. 

267
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,040
- Did you put salt on the top as well? 
- Just a tiny bit, yeah. 

268
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,240
- You didn't need it.
- Right. 

269
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,240
That salt has tipped it over to be very salty. 

270
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,320
SOFT SNAP 

271
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,360
Just about. 

272
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,040
They're beautifully crisp. 

273
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,760
Difficult to achieve. 

274
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,840
- One or two of them are a little bit overbaked.
- Yes, yes. 

275
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,920
- MEL: I can't believe you just did that.
- Oh, don't take that one. 

276
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,760
I do like the flavour. I like the seeds as well. 

277
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,560
That little bit of fire in there from the cayenne. 

278
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,480
Well done to get them so wafer thin and full of flavour. 

279
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,680
- Nice one, James. Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.
- Do we have to go? 

280
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,240
I'm really sorry. I'm so embarrassed. 

281
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,080
They're really disastrous. I'm really sorry. 

282
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,680
There are only 46, for which I'm also sorry. 

283
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,200
- They don't look particularly good. 
- No, they're shocking. 

284
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,040
It's thick and thin. 

285
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,320
Irregular colours. 

286
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,240
- The bakes, you go from that... 
- Oh, don't. 

287
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,640
- ..to that.
- Yeah, I know. 

288
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,080
That one you can bend. 

289
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,760
- Oh, lor'.
- That one will snap. 

290
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,680
That's a lovely crack, though, on that. 

291
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,160
- CRACKER SNAPS 
- It is. 

292
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,240
Great flavour, but poorly... 

293
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,600
Yeah, I know, just dreadful. I know. 

294
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,920
You've got, obviously, some darker ones here. 

295
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,760
- But let's just see what the... 
- The Hollywood crack. 

296
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,080
- BISCUIT SNAPS 
- Yeah, it's breaking well. 

297
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,440
It's lovely and crisp. Hint of curry. 

298
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,600
One or two of them are a little overbaked. 

299
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,360
It just makes them a little bit bitter. 

300
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,560
Flavour's lovely, and it is crispy. And they're all the same size. 

301
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,520
- I'd like to have seen them a little bit bigger, though.
- OK. 

302
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,320
Well, you could always have twice as many! 

303
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,160
I think I've found my confidence again. 

304
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,680
If I let last week fester away inside me, then I'm going to fail. 

305
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,200
But I just need to get over it, forget about it, and carry on. 

306
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,720
The competition at the moment is variable in the remaining five. 

307
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,720
There's certainly two or three that I'm keeping an eye on. 

308
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,040
But, may the best man win. 

309
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,960
It's now all about knowledge and technique, 

310
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,800
and I've been round the track a bit longer than most of them. 

311
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,000
I was designing them as a cracker with drinks. 

312
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,880
I think Paul's comment about the salt is fair, 

313
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,680
but that's not a hanging offence. 

314
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,240
I don't want it to look like I'm not giving it everything 

315
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,080
because my family will be disappointed 

316
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,920
if they saw me not trying hard enough. 

317
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,920
It just takes really one bad round to get you kicked out. 

318
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,280
Everyone relies on a bit of luck. Me, more than anyone. 

319
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,600
In a small corner of north Wales, 

320
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,800
there is a regional biscuit which has been baked for centuries. 

321
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,600
Now, it's not as famous as its Yorkshire Rich Tea 

322
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,240
or Scottish shortbread siblings, 

323
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,640
but its distinctive appearance and mysterious origins 

324
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,160
make it one of the most charming biscuits in Britain. 

325
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,960
The island of Anglesey is known as the Mother of Wales. 

326
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,200
Its fertile soil and abundant crops 

327
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,760
supply the whole country with a rich variety of produce. 

328
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,760
One delicious bake, born from the plentiful Anglesey wheat, 

329
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,160
is a distinctively scallop-shaped biscuit, steeped in local legend. 

330
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,520
The Aberffraw biscuit 

331
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,040
is one of the oldest biscuits in Britain and, indeed, Wales. 

332
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,360
It's made similar to shortbread, 

333
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,200
but what really sets it apart is this amazing scallop shape. 

334
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,840
One of the reasons for that is that 

335
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,240
scallops have been found in the waters of Anglesey for centuries. 

336
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,680
One local legend has it that the wife of the Prince of Wales, 

337
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,080
who held court in Aberffraw in the 13th century, 

338
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,960
was walking on the beach, she picked up a scallop, brought it back, 

339
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,880
and he had the biscuit made in honour of her. 

340
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,680
The Aberffraw biscuit is also locally known as the James cake, 

341
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,840
named in honour of St James, one of the 12 apostles, 

342
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,520
whose symbol is a scallop. 

343
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,360
There's a strong Celtic culture in Wales, 

344
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,520
and that is shared in parts of Spain, 

345
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,840
especially in Santiago de Compostela 

346
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,040
which happens to be the burial place of St James. 

347
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,440
It's known that pilgrims from Anglesey 

348
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,000
would have made this pilgrimage 

349
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,200
and, traditionally, pilgrims to Santiago wore scalloped hats 

350
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
and a scallop around their neck. 

351
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,160
So it's very likely that 

352
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,200
the biscuit continued to be made for all these centuries 

353
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,080
as a tribute to St James and to the people who'd made the pilgrimage. 

354
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,440
The Aberffaw biscuit is traditionally made 

355
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,080
using the wheat produced by the hundreds of windmills 

356
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,520
that once dotted the Anglesey landscape. 

357
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,160
The Linen Mill is the last surviving working windmill on the island. 

358
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,360
But that hasn't stopped local bakers 

359
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,800
from continuing to make this homegrown delicacy. 

360
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,200
The Aberffraw biscuit is quite famous on Anglesey. 

361
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,480
We call it the Teisennau Aberffraw. 

362
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,240
Every year, in the Anglesey Show, 

363
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,080
there's a competition for six pieces of Aberffraw biscuits. 

364
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,800
Each one of them had to be identical, 

365
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,280
and that was a craft in itself. 

366
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,280
The Aberffraw biscuit is a shortbread mixture made from sugar, 

367
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,960
Welsh farmhouse butter, 

368
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,960
and a mixture of plain white and wholemeal flour. 

369
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,720
The wholemeal flour ground in the mill has a grainy quality 

370
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,160
that has traditionally been used to give a sandy texture, 

371
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,160
evoking the beaches where the scallop shells were first discovered. 

372
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,560
Instead of rolling it out, 

373
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,080
it is pressed on to the shell, 

374
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,600
so that you can see the shell shape on the finished biscuits. 

375
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,080
The Aberffraw biscuit is unique to Anglesey. 

376
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,440
It is something that is only made on this island. 

377
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,280
The Aberffraw biscuit uniquely captures the spirit of Anglesey. 

378
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,680
Shaped like the shells of its beaches 

379
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,360
and made with the grain from its mills, 

380
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,520
it has gained a special place in the folklore and tradition of the island. 

381
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,400
The quarterfinalists have no idea 

382
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,000
what kind of biscuit they'll be asked to bake next. 

383
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,440
It's time to reveal the old Technical Challenge. 

384
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,560
As you know by now, this is always judged blind. 

385
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,000
So, Paul and Mary, off you go please, 

386
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,360
to the place that you go at this time. 

387
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,800
The pub! 

388
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,680
For today's Technical Challenge, 

389
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,360
we'd like you to create an iconic biscuit. 

390
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,280
It's got a biscuit base, 

391
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,360
then tower of marshmallow, topped with a dome of chocolate. 

392
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,480
Because today, we're asking you to make six chocolate tea cakes. 

393
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,280
- In 30 degree heat. 
- Enjoy tempering that! 

394
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,360
You've got two hours. 

395
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,560
- So on your marks.
- Get set. 

396
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,960
- BOTH:
- Bake! 

397
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,680
The heat could be the least of the bakers' worries. 

398
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,640
Marshmallow chocolate tea cake. 

399
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,440
I know them, I see them in the shops. I have never made one. 

400
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,920
Paul's recipe only contains very basic instructions. 

401
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,240
This is like hell on a plate. 

402
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,240
Quarterfinal chocolate tea cakes. Magnificent. 

403
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,920
They are very difficult to make. A bit stagey. 

404
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,920
What we've got is a homemade digestive biscuit. 

405
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,280
Wow! Look at that. 

406
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,840
The dome itself, we've given them a rubber mould, 

407
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,360
with six domes inside it. 

408
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,400
If it's too thin near the top, 

409
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,160
when they finally try to bring the dome away from the mould, 

410
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,840
the whole thing will collapse. 

411
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,080
It's a bit like putting a cork in a bottle, 

412
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,800
putting that biscuit into the dome. It's got to fit down into it 

413
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,160
and then you just seal it with a bit more chocolate. 

414
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,120
So, really hot day, doing something chocolate is tricky. 

415
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,600
I think, on this occasion, you're going to have to be really kind. 

416
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,680
Never done anything like this. No idea how to even approach it. 

417
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,040
I think I can make the biscuit. 

418
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,840
Digestive biscuits should be a straightforward combination 

419
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,200
of wholemeal flour, sugar and butter. 

420
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Maybe I should have melted the butter. 

421
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,040
It wants more butter. That's why it's not coming together. 

422
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,960
But wholemeal flour contains little gluten. 

423
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,280
The biscuit dough is extremely short. 

424
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,520
"Short" means the gluten strands are short 

425
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,560
and so it doesn't really hold together. 

426
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,960
It's a very crumbly biscuit, with a good crumb to it, 

427
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,640
a very tender crumb. 

428
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,360
The biscuit dough made from wholemeal flour 

429
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,400
is incredibly vulnerable to overworking. 

430
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,000
It's a very dry dough, but I'm sticking with the recipe. 

431
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,240
You're tempted, at this point, to put in a little more liquid. 

432
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,480
I'm just going to torture it a bit, until I get it to bind together. 

433
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,320
Handling it too much 

434
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,320
can produce an unacceptably rubbery and chewy biscuit. 

435
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,760
I don't mind if it is a bit short. 

436
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,400
- There's not much there!
- No. You've got to get it really thin. 

437
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,480
Most biscuits, you seem to have to get them about five millimetres. 

438
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,000
- I might have to get the ruler out. 
- I like it when you get the ruler out. 

439
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,200
It's very dry, isn't it? 

440
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,440
The bakers need to cut six biscuits from the dough. 

441
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,280
Brendan's just a machine. Look at him go. 

442
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,760
The thickness is up to them. 

443
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,800
It's meant to be like the digestive biscuits 

444
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,360
you buy in the shops? I don't know. Maybe. 

445
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,360
And Paul has only given one instruction for baking them. 

446
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,640
BEEPING 

447
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,800
The oven temperature. 

448
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,480
How long's the biscuits need? 

449
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,760
They need to be baked long enough to be just crisp. 

450
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,960
Ten minutes. 

451
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,840
A fraction too long, and the high sugar contents in these biscuits 

452
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,240
will burn and taste bitter. 

453
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,520
- HE SIGHS HEAVILY 
- I can't work in this heat. 

454
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,280
I'm actually dripping in sweat. 

455
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,280
Makes them look better if you put them upside down. 

456
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,880
You want them so that they feel firm 

457
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,800
and that they're just starting to go at the edges, 

458
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,480
says she, never having made a digestive biscuit in her life! 

459
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,000
As the digestive biscuits cool, 

460
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,040
the bakers have to temper chocolate for their teacake topping. 

461
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,640
Tempering changes the sugar formation in the chocolate, 

462
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,160
so that it sets really hard with a great shine on it, you can crack it. 

463
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,000
The chocolate has to be heated to exactly 45 degrees Celsius, 

464
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,960
and then cooled rapidly to 32 degrees. 

465
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,920
It's 35 degrees in here. 

466
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,120
- Oh dear, and you want your chocolate to be 33?
- 33 or 32, yes. 

467
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,560
- OK, so we've got an issue already. 
- HE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY 

468
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,800
After tempering, 

469
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,600
the chocolate has to be the right consistency to coat the mould. 

470
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,080
I want it to be a slower pourer than that, 

471
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,360
so that it will stick to the sides. 

472
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,480
If I put it in now, it'll all sink to the bottom. 

473
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,920
I don't know how much chocolate I'm putting on. 

474
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,200
I think it's got to hold marshmallow in it, and biscuit at the bottom. 

475
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,480
So I think it needs to be quite thick. 

476
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,560
I think it's a bit like if you make Easter eggs. 

477
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,440
The best thing to do is to put a thin layer on, let it dry, 

478
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,280
and if you don't think it's thick enough, just put another layer on. 

479
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,360
The heat's just obviously melting the chocolate. 

480
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,120
And, if the chocolate doesn't hold, you won't have a teacake. 

481
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,080
You'll just have a big messy thing on a plate. 

482
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,360
They'll have to go in the fridge or else they're not going to come out. 

483
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,120
You should never fridge chocolate, straight from melting. 

484
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,600
You should really let it cool to room temperature 

485
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,960
before you put it near the fridge, at least. 

486
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,920
We don't have room temperature here. 

487
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,720
We have hot. 

488
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,040
Cooling the chocolate in the fridge could result in a bloom, 

489
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,520
making it lose its shine and gloss. 

490
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,000
OK, bakers, two things to note. 

491
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,480
A, there's a massive cross-wind going through the tents. 

492
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,200
It's almost blowing my wig off. 

493
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,000
Secondly, you've got one hour remaining. One hour. 

494
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,520
For the marshmallow, 

495
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,040
traditional meringue ingredients are combined with golden syrup 

496
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,000
to stabilise the mixture and give structure. 

497
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,840
I've never made marshmallow before. 

498
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,840
I think it's some kind of Swiss meringue, by the looks of it. 

499
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,040
It's then whisked to a temperature of 65 degrees over a bain marie 

500
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,640
to gently heat the egg whites. 

501
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,960
You don't want it to cook the sugar or the eggs. 

502
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,720
When it starts to do that, if it feels grainy on the bottom of the bowl with your hand whisk, 

503
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,000
which obviously you can't feel if you're using an electric whisk. 

504
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,720
Everyone's finding this quite tricky, aren't they? 

505
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,600
I've not heard Brendan. 

506
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,760
That guy can do anything. 

507
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,480
Oh... Well, look, it's rather nice actually. It's quite stiff. 

508
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,000
I take it this is what it would look like. 

509
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,400
My first encounter with marshmallow. 

510
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,840
It's quite a funny texture, 

511
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,760
but I guess that's how it should be. 

512
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,040
Oh, wow, this is really good. 

513
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,240
That's a good marshmallow. 

514
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,080
My marshmallow's not very marshmallow-like, but James's is. 

515
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,600
So perhaps I should have whisked it for a bit longer. 

516
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,680
I'm wondering if dipping is the best way forward. 

517
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,480
A chocolate coating ensures the biscuit stays crisp 

518
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,840
when sealed into the teacake. 

519
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,560
I want them to be covered in chocolate, 

520
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,480
but I really don't want to break them. 

521
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,520
If the chocolate coating is too thick, 

522
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,160
the biscuit won't sit in the mould. 

523
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,920
I'll settle for that. I'm easily pleased. 

524
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,040
My chocolate hasn't set at all. 

525
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,200
Cathryn's chosen not to chill her domes or biscuits... 

526
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,960
I don't want to put them in the fridge 

527
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,920
but I'm going to have to, aren't I? 

528
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,520
..in an attempt to avoid losing the shine on the chocolate surface. 

529
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,760
You can see why you don't put chocolate straight into the fridge, 

530
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,160
because of this dull hardness. 

531
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,440
And it's not just the weather that's against her. 

532
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,520
Bakers, just 30 minutes remaining. 

533
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,200
Oh, no! 

534
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,040
All the bakers must now factor in enough remaining time 

535
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,720
to fill, assemble and re-chill their teacake. 

536
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,000
I'm filling them about four-fifths full, 

537
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,200
because there's a biscuit now to sit on that. 

538
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
So I take it, it should be flat. 

539
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,120
Let's have a little wee look at them. 

540
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,040
- SHE SIGHS 
- It's not what I want to do, but... 

541
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,080
Or shall I just pipe, 

542
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,520
and set the whole thing as one instead of wasting time? 

543
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,960
That's what I'm going to do. Probably going to be a big mistake. 

544
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,880
I'm using as much of this chocolate as I can 

545
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,960
because I don't want any leaks or breakages or anything. 

546
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,840
All the bakers can do now is wait. 

547
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,160
Lovely bakers, you've got ten minutes to go, 

548
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,920
so you'd better start finishing up, pronto. 

549
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,200
Each delicate teacake must now be removed from the mould. 

550
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,000
- Please be careful.
- Please. 

551
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,600
Is that a good way to do it? 

552
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,200
Or do you think you ought to turn them? 

553
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,760
- That's the way to do it. 
- Ooh, my word! 

554
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,240
- You've made a teacake!
- I didn't think I'd ever make a teacake. 

555
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,280
Look at him. 

556
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,720
- I quite like this. 
- I don't know whether to eat it 

557
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,640
or set up a shrine in honour of it. 

558
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,360
That's beautiful! 

559
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,200
Oh! 

560
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,000
Oh, my gosh, I hope mine look like this. 

561
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,840
They're quite easy to pop out, though, 

562
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,440
so I'm going to wait right to the last minute. 

563
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,600
I'm delighted actually, and it's nice and shiny, 

564
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,520
which suggests the chocolate is tempered. 

565
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,840
They're melting. Can I have a plate? 

566
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,120
Oh! 

567
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,000
They're not ready! 

568
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,440
Oh, lor'. I don't know what to do. 

569
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,760
- What the heck? 
- Argh, they're not ready! 

570
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,760
What do you mean, they're not ready? 

571
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,280
- They keep like, they're broken. 
- What do you mean, they're broken? 

572
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,360
- Argh! 
- You mean the base is separating? 

573
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,520
Well, no, look. 

574
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,000
- That's fine. 
- But they're still so... No, look! 

575
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,880
What am I going to do? Oh, lord. What am I going to do? 

576
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,760
- Fridge. Fridge and pray. 
- Oh, my giddy aunt. 

577
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,480
Oh, man, this is not... 

578
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,720
Bakers, you've got five minutes left. Five minutes left. 

579
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,800
Oh, man. 

580
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,440
Oh, no! 

581
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,520
- There's five minutes left. They've got to come out.
- Oh, no. 

582
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,600
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. 

583
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,400
She's had a bit of a mare of a day, really. 

584
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,920
Positive, positive, positive. 

585
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,840
- They're pooper scoops. They're just horrendous!
- They're fine. 

586
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,880
- Oh, man. What shall I do?
- They're going to be great.
- Right. Er... 

587
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,760
- Oh, man.
- Individually, individually. 

588
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,720
- Oh, no, look!
- That's OK. 

589
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,560
No. Oh, my giddy aunt. 

590
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,520
Oh, my giddy aunt! 

591
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,680
So that's a bit embarrassing, isn't it? 

592
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,960
And that's it, bakers, your time is up. 

593
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,160
Please step completely away from your teacakes. 

594
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,880
- Shall we start with this one?
- Yes. 

595
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,360
The tempered chocolate - obviously there was an issue. 

596
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,200
Lovely, crisp biscuit. 

597
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,280
The problem with the marshmallow inside that one... 

598
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,960
- It's more like whipped cream. 
- It is, yeah. 

599
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,800
This one has had a few issues with the dome itself. It's too thin. 

600
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,040
Tastes good. 

601
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,280
It's a lovely, crisp biscuit, a very good marshmallow. 

602
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,040
The biscuit's sort of making this one rock a bit, you know. 

603
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,760
- It's got a good shine on it, though. 
- Thicker biscuit on that one. 

604
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,200
Quite thick biscuit on that one. 

605
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,080
And there's a lot of chocolate underneath. 

606
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,960
You need to scrape down the bottom on these to keep them flat. 

607
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,440
Because you don't want it too thick so it ends up rocking. 

608
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,440
The meringue's pretty good. 

609
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,760
This hasn't got a bad shine on it. 

610
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,400
Good biscuit inside. 

611
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:08,960
The meringue inside is just a little bit runny here, isn't it? 

612
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,880
It needed a bit longer on the mix. 

613
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,400
This one... 

614
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,800
Looks a good, firm marshmallow. 

615
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,160
It's cut through nicely. 

616
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,520
It's the first one that's cut through absolutely neatly and firmly. 

617
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,360
Yeah. It's got a good biscuit base on that one, as well. 

618
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,880
But, overall, pretty good considering the temperature. 

619
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,600
I think that's quite an achievement on such a day. 

620
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,480
It's a bit runny. 

621
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,480
'But whose teacakes could be a stepping stone to the semifinal?' 

622
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,160
'And who could have tackled their last technical challenge?' 

623
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,160
In fifth place is this one. The problem is with the dome. 

624
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,480
The biscuit, actually, was good, 

625
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,200
the marshmallow's good, but the dome was terrible. 

626
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,680
Whether it wasn't chilled enough or not thick enough, there was a problem. 

627
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,800
And, in fourth place, the join wasn't so good 

628
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,760
and the marshmallow was a little bit runny. 

629
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,840
In third place was this one. 

630
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,400
These three were actually quite close, but this one, 

631
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,560
because of the marshmallow being too weak... 

632
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,440
And number two? Almost there, wouldn't you say? 

633
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,160
The biscuit's a bit thick on that one, 

634
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,560
but you had the best shine out of all of them. 

635
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,320
And number one is this one. 

636
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,760
- James.
- James! 

637
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,240
Overall, you had a good base, a great meringue 

638
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,000
and that dome as well... 

639
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,240
I mean, you ticked all the boxes. 

640
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,320
'It was impossible to call it.' 

641
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,000
Even after the judging, I thought I could have been easily bottom. 

642
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,880
'I think that the only thing that differentiated me from number one' 

643
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,600
was the thickness of a biscuit. 

644
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,640
I don't think I can leave today and think, 

645
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,840
"That's OK, my place in the next round is assured." 

646
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,000
But, to be honest, at this stage, I don't think anyone can feel 

647
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,240
that their place in the next round is assured. 

648
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,040
I thought you weren't supposed to chill chocolate in the fridge, 

649
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,080
so I didn't. 

650
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,480
Bang in the middle again. I've been there for some time. 

651
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,200
If I mess up tomorrow, I could still go home, 

652
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,240
cos Paul doesn't like people who stick in the middle. 

653
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,920
One biscuit challenge remaining. 

654
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:25,760
And one baker won't make it through to the semi-final. 

655
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,720
Who would you say is leading the pack at the moment? 

656
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,440
Brendan is certainly leading the pack. 

657
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,080
He's been consistently good. 

658
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,880
I actually thought James's crackers were very good. 

659
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,080
Obviously, he came first in the technical challenge as well. 

660
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,080
Who is possibly slightly lagging behind? 

661
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,160
Cathryn was bottom on technical. 

662
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,440
She had such difficulty with her chocolate. 

663
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,560
She is the one that isn't using thermometers. 

664
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,040
She's a true home baker. 

665
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,680
I think you could also put Danny and John in there as well, 

666
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,080
because Danny's biscuits were over-seasoned. 

667
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,000
John, there was a lot of different variants in colour in that as well. 

668
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,440
He's erratic, John. He has flashes of brilliance. 

669
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,720
Danny, I'm surprised to see in that position, 

670
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,360
because she's been very solid. 

671
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,440
Good morning, bakers. 

672
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,200
First up, a very happy birthday to James, who is 21 today. 

673
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,400
James, today, the world's your oyster - 

674
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,680
you can become an MEP and you can go to adult prison! 

675
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,080
The choice is yours. 

676
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,360
Now, today is the Showstopper Challenge. 

677
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:29,120
And this stands between you and a place in the semifinals. 

678
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,880
We are asking you today to channel your inner Hansels and Gretels 

679
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,400
and build a gingerbread structure. 

680
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,640
Not just any old gingerbread structure - 

681
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,320
you've got to take the normal gingerbread house to another level. 

682
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,520
Sydney Opera House, Eiffel Tower, like that. 

683
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,240
You've only got four hours to bake and build, 

684
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,160
- so on your marks...
- Get set... 

685
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,280
..bake! 

686
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,520
The gingerbread house is a tradition that became popular in Germany 

687
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,000
after the publication of Grimms' Fairy Tales. 

688
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,280
It's now become synonymous with Christmas. 

689
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,400
This is a particularly fantastic challenge. 

690
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,520
This is the gingerbread structure. 

691
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,760
Not house! 

692
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,000
If you make me a house, I will smash it down, I'll blow your doors in. 

693
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,800
What we're looking for is a bit of architectural genius. 

694
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,840
It's going to be one of the most exciting things 

695
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,800
that we've seen on the Bake Off. 

696
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,840
- DANNY:
- 'This is an awful lot of dough 

697
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,800
'and an awful lot of stuff to be processing in four hours. 

698
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,120
'I make gingerbread,' 

699
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:31,840
but I have not got a tradition of trying to build something with it! 

700
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,600
Basic gingerbread is a mix of flour, brown sugar, golden syrup, 

701
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,800
and ground ginger. 

702
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,720
I'm going to do it a little bit thicker than I normally would, 

703
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,400
just for safety. 

704
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,360
The gingerbread needs a stable structure, 

705
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,840
but the flavour has to be good as well. 

706
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,680
So I'm adding in additional spices - 

707
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,120
it's a mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. 

708
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,400
DANNY: You want molasses, because it adds a really nice, treacly flavour. 

709
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,280
But pomegranate molasses tastes a little bit fruity. 

710
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,320
It doesn't make the gingerbread taste fruity. 

711
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,800
It actually makes the gingerbread taste of caramel. 

712
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,440
- JOHN:
- I put black treacle in as well - 

713
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,200
it has a dark flavour you want in it, 

714
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,440
just to make it a little bit more sophisticated and malty. 

715
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,080
I am doing chocolate and orange flavour. 

716
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:18,520
I do make this with my children, but only, you know, talking like this. 

717
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,400
But this is going to be pretty big, so it's not ordinary. 

718
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,840
Cathryn's grand design is for a chocolate and orange 

719
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,120
spiced gingerbread Buckingham Palace. 

720
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,000
- You couldn't go grander than that! 
- That's what I thought. 

721
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,280
I'm using chocolate to separate the windows. 

722
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,000
It has a lot of windows, so I practiced cutting them out. 

723
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,240
As there are so many, it weakens the structure and it distorts the shape, 

724
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,640
so I'm sticking them on rather than cutting them out. 

725
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,760
I think you're being very positive about this. 

726
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,160
You are very upbeat for it, so it'll be good, won't it? 

727
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,000
It's going to be good. You're going to like it. 

728
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,320
- DANNY:
- I have baked this structure a couple of times. 

729
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,600
Once, it went brilliantly. 

730
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,160
Once, it kind of went boom, boom, boom, straight down. 

731
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,320
Danny's gingerbread, made with ginger syrup and pomegranate molasses, 

732
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,080
should rise in the form of Big Ben. 

733
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,240
- How tall is it going to be? 
- Two feet tall. 

734
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,800
- Two feet tall?! 
- Yeah.
- That's nearly as big as Mel! 

735
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,080
And how are you going to bind it all together? 

736
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,200
Caramel to hold the weight, really. 

737
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,200
And then I'll probably use some icing, 

738
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,480
just to kind of fill in the gaps. 

739
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,880
Well, caramel is a very good sticking agent. 

740
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,160
And it's a lovely, dry day. 

741
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,040
If it was a wet day, and all damp, that would affect the caramel. 

742
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,160
But, today, it'll hold it together beautifully. 

743
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,280
I hope so. I mean, the issue I've had is actually... 

744
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,560
I've realised how much respect I have for the Ancient Egyptians 

745
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,040
..is getting a square-based pyramid! That took me ages! 

746
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,400
All of the bakers, except James, 

747
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,720
have made templates for their buildings. 

748
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,000
They're shaping their dough into pieces before they go into the oven. 

749
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,040
It took a week to design these, 

750
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,320
like, get the logistics and the measurements 

751
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,600
and then Paul, my amazing partner, he did it. 

752
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,440
- Paul printed that up?
- He printed that for me.
- Is he an architect? 

753
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,680
He's a graphic designer and works for an architect. 

754
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,040
- This is where you come into your own, then.
- Yeah. It is. 

755
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,960
So you've been looking for a baking building project, the two of you, 

756
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,240
and now you've found one. 

757
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,000
John is adding black treacle 

758
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,120
and spices to his epic gingerbread Coliseum. 

759
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,560
He'll also be making a peanut praline gravel. 

760
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:17,360
- This looks very complicated.
- Over 100 pieces.
- Over 100 pieces?
- Yeah. 

761
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,280
So I'll get all of these pieces 

762
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,360
and then, with the sugar caramel, I'll stick them together. 

763
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,080
- Oh, my days.
- And then up again. 

764
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,440
What sort of flavour? Are we going to expect something hot and fiery? 

765
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,120
Not too hot and fiery, but it'll have a strong ginger flavour, 

766
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,840
because the Coliseum is about strength and fighting. 

767
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,720
- All right. Thanks, John. 
- As they say in Latin, bona fortunas. 

768
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,760
Bona fortunas. 

769
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,000
- Bona fortorna. Fortuna?
- Grazie. 

770
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,520
This isn't at all my sort of baking, 

771
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,360
but I have come round to this challenge. 

772
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:48,040
It's not baking, it's building. And I like building. 

773
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,040
James's pristine barn will be built out of gingerbread biscuit planks, 

774
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,720
with a softer gingerbread cake for cladding. 

775
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,880
So you're starting off by baking all the gingerbread - 

776
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,960
the walls, the tiles, the roof - 

777
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,360
and then you're going to assemble it and stick it together with what? 

778
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,440
- Caramel. Yes, caramel. 
- Well, that should hold it firmly. 

779
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,800
- What sort of size are we looking at here?
- Life size. 
- Two foot by one foot. 

780
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,920
- Sorry? Two foot. 
- Two foot by how high?
- I don't know. 

781
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,000
You don't know. 

782
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,600
- However big I can get away with pitching the angle at. 
- MARY:
- This is the construction plan? 

783
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,560
- This is my rough plan, yes. 
- Good luck, James. 

784
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,280
- Have a nice relaxing day. 
- Oh, I will. 

785
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,360
'Planning is essential. The bakers should prioritise 

786
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,000
'baking the pieces of gingerbread they need to build with first 

787
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,240
'if they're to finish on time.' 

788
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,960
For me, it needs to be all crisp, or else it's going to bend and fall down. 

789
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,280
'Depending on the size of the pieces, 

790
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,800
'baking time can vary wildly from five to 20 minutes.' 

791
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,240
Bit longer. 

792
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,120
When it comes to artistic expression, 

793
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,040
Britain's bakers have been turning to gingerbread for centuries. 

794
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,520
And although styles and shapes may change, one town in particular 

795
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,440
has been granted the moniker "home of gingerbread". 

796
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,800
In the beautiful setting of the Cumbrian countryside 

797
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,800
lies Grasmere, a town with a rich tradition of gingerbread baking. 

798
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,560
And at the world famous gingerbread shop, a unique romantic gift 

799
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,920
is sold that revives a tradition dating back to medieval times. 

800
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,480
Gingerbread was given originally as a love token, 

801
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,920
usually by knights 

802
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,360
given to fair maidens before jousting competitions, 

803
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,880
so it's like an original favour. 

804
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,720
These little love tokens were absolutely gorgeous. 

805
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,240
They were little shield-shaped gingerbreads 

806
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,240
or heart-shaped gingerbreads and it was obviously because ginger 

807
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,320
was very expensive spice and it warms the blood and encourages love. 

808
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,680
And that's what made them very, very special. It was a very sought-after thing. 

809
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,880
Over time, the celebratory gift of gingerbread 

810
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,960
increased in popularity throughout Europe 

811
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,760
and by the 16th and 17th centuries, these highly prized biscuits 

812
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,040
had evolved into spectacular works of art. 

813
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,280
In the Netherlands, there was a tradition 

814
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,320
of giving a ritual token of two gingerbreads at a wedding. 

815
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,520
One was in the form of Abraham and the other one 

816
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,280
was in the form of his wife, Sarah, from the Old Testament. 

817
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,440
Now, they thought they couldn't conceive because they were too old, 

818
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,800
but an angel appeared to them 

819
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,320
and said, "You're going to have a child," - Isaac, which they did. 

820
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,040
So, in Holland, what they did, they had these figures 

821
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,920
which represented Abraham and Sarah and they were given 

822
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,560
to the bride and groom in the hope 

823
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,400
that they too would conceive and have lots of children. 

824
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,720
Such intricately detailed gingerbread men and women 

825
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,040
weren't just presented at weddings. 

826
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,680
They were sold as gifts to celebrate a huge variety of events. 

827
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,160
Some of the most elaborate were reserved for royal occasions. 

828
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,760
This mould, which dates from the late 17th century, represents 

829
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:44,600
King William III and on the other side, it's got Mary, his queen. 

830
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,960
And it may have been sold 

831
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,400
at the time of the coronation on the streets of London. 

832
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,400
The remarkable casts that you get from these are some of 

833
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,040
the most beautiful gingerbreads in the history of England. 

834
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,240
I mean, just look at King William here, 

835
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,800
with this incredible detail on his waistcoat and coat. 

836
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,880
Every part of it is just completely covered. 

837
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,000
So, this is really a work of art. 

838
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,760
Smaller gingerbread figures would have been presented 

839
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,920
at 17th century aristocratic banquets, 

840
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,840
using a popular recipe known as white gingerbread. 

841
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,840
Flavoured with almonds and coated with sugar paste, 

842
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,360
it provided a fine texture for picking up such ornate detail. 

843
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,800
This little Shakespearian gingerbread I've got here 

844
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,120
was used for making a very high-status type of gingerbread. 

845
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,800
These gingerbreads were frequently gilded 

846
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,680
and, obviously, gold leaf is a precious metal. 

847
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,160
So it was expensive. But the idea was to have 

848
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,120
something on the table that looked sensational. 

849
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,800
As ginger has become more common, 

850
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,600
gingerbread has now lost much of its romanticism, 

851
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,960
but whilst we can now find a card for any occasion, 

852
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,120
for our ancestors, there was nothing that couldn't be said 

853
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,240
without the help of a piece of gingerbread. 

854
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,400
'There are just two hours to go in the Showstopper Challenge.' 

855
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,880
I've still got 18 windows to make. 

856
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,760
'The baking time is crucial. 

857
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,320
'Any variation in bake or thickness could create 

858
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,920
'a weakness in the structure.' 

859
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,520
No idea how this is going to turn out. 

860
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,600
Don't even know if it's going to be soft or hard. 

861
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,920
I hope, right now, it's hard enough to cool, 

862
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,040
but I may need to bake it again. 

863
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,520
That's one roof. 

864
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,440
You know your life is taking a strange twist and turn 

865
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,520
when you find yourself asking questions about 

866
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,520
what's a good edible material that would make 

867
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,480
a good thatched roof on a gingerbread house. 

868
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,760
'Brendan's thatched gingerbread bird house will be surrounded by 

869
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:38,320
'grass made from dried coconut and be home to two fondant icing residents.' 

870
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,600
That's interesting. You've baked it and then you trim it after baking. 

871
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,200
It's a slight spread you get with it. 

872
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,520
Of course, to hold it all together, you need to keep it very accurate. 

873
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,280
- PAUL:
- While it's warm, it's the best time to do it.
- Absolutely. 

874
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,360
Even if it does hurt your fingers a little bit. 

875
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,800
I'm going to put it into a lovely, cute Walt Disney-type setting. 

876
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,360
There's going to be lots of flowering clematis all over it, 

877
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,720
climbing up the sides and across the roof. 

878
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,720
- I'm going to make two blue birds out of icing.
- Fantastic. 

879
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,600
Well, it'll give us a piece of your little mind then when we look at your construction later. 

880
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,280
Knowing Brendan, the birds will actually be tweeting as well. 

881
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,080
- They probably will.
- They will be. 
- On the hour.
- Good luck, Brendan. 
- Thank you.
- Thanks, bye-bye. 

882
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,360
I'm making a few small changes 

883
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,800
in order to have something that looks better at the end, 

884
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,680
cos I don't want to steam roller through and then have something 

885
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,240
that looks really shoddy at the end. 

886
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,280
So you think you might be a bit pushed for time? 

887
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,480
I'm totally pushed for time. 

888
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,120
So, you're going to modify our monarch's home? 

889
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,320
- I'm going to slightly tweak Buck House.
- What are you doing? 

890
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,400
- A little extension? Conservatory? Patio?
- No, I'm downsizing. 

891
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,880
It's a bungalow. I've changed my mind. It's a royal bungalow. 

892
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,160
Time for the grand assembly. 

893
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,840
Most of the bakers are using caramel as the glue. 

894
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,280
I don't know if that's burnt or not. 

895
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,400
But it has to be kept at exactly the right temperature 

896
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,120
to stick the structure together. 

897
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:02,240
That caramel's just rubbish. Not gluing anything. It's far too hard. 

898
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,960
It's quite fun when things go your way. Like, this is horrible. 

899
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,480
This is a horrible situation. 

900
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,040
It needs to be soft, really soft in order for it to stick. It's not. 

901
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,160
To cement his structure, Brendan is using royal icing. 

902
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,640
It takes longer to dry than caramel, 

903
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,600
but once set, is more stable. 

904
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,280
- I catch you mid-roofing. 
- You do. Under pressure now. 

905
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,960
This is the trickiest bit - getting the roof to adhere. 

906
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,560
So far, so good. 

907
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,600
I'm going to start assembling the front, 

908
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,760
so that's got time to set and then crack on. 

909
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,920
This competition means the world to me and to win it would be amazing. 

910
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,200
Everything I want to do in my life is bake. 

911
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,040
So, that's why I'm taking the care now, 

912
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,360
cos I can't afford to make any more stupid mistakes. 

913
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:53,200
Well, it's the quarter finals and I think nobody's safe. 

914
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,000
So, you could easily be on your way out if something goes wrong. 

915
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,040
Time is getting the better of James and, with the build under way, 

916
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,760
he's only just getting the ginger cake that will form 

917
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,080
the wall of his barn in the oven. 

918
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,800
It's got the roof to go on. I've got the bricks to be built. 

919
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,120
All the slates to be made, cut and put on. 

920
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,840
We don't have enough time to do it all, so we're going to have to start cutting bits. 

921
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,040
I'm not sure which bits are going to go. 

922
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,120
The male will have a coxcomb and the female doesn't, 

923
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,000
so, I thought I would give her some mascara. 

924
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,080
You know, I've spent years creating a certain image, 

925
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,920
which is now going to be blown apart. 

926
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,520
I don't believe my life. I really don't. 

927
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,280
OK, bakers, 15 minutes left on your bake/build. 

928
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,000
Time-wise, I'm running a bit behind now. 

929
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,640
I mean, I'm going to be able to finish the structure, the coliseum. 

930
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,720
It's just going to be an issue of decoration. 

931
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,120
I don't think the Queen would like this much. 

932
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,200
I think she'd be a bit naffed off with me if she saw this. 

933
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,880
It's a total disaster. 

934
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,520
It's gone from looking rather lovely to absolute disaster. 

935
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,440
Oh, Sue. 

936
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,680
- What have you done, darling? 
- I don't know. 

937
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,440
The barn seems to have changed from the original plans submitted. 

938
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,960
Yes. 

939
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,160
It's a derelict barn. I think I should get marks for ambition. 

940
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,960
Ah! 

941
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,920
It's literally buckling under its own sorry weight. 

942
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,560
Bakers, one minute before the gingerbread repossession people 

943
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,880
come and take your houses away from you. 

944
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,680
It's OK. I've got the tower constructed. 

945
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,200
There's a crack in the clock tower, which is slightly unfortunate. 

946
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,120
So, I'm literally going to leave it to the very last moment 

947
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,560
to put the roof on. 

948
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,840
I don't think Paul will be that impressed. 

949
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,200
I mean, it's certainly not the standard of Brendan's 

950
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,280
beauteous edifice over there. 

951
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,200
I'm quite close to completion. It's just a bit messier than I'd have liked it to be. 

952
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,680
But, you know, it is an old building. 

953
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,800
It's bound to, you know, not look great. 

954
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,080
Stable. Really quite strong. 

955
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,360
But not happy with it. 

956
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,240
This is like Meccano for boys with baking. 

957
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,040
It's on. Please, stay there. 

958
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,760
OK, bakers, out of time. 

959
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,360
Shutting the build down as of now. Step away. 

960
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,880
Danny, away from the massive clock. 

961
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,680
That looks wicked, Danny. 

962
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,760
That's pretty good, to be honest. 

963
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,760
- Oh, don't break it. 
- The sacking of Rome.
- Oh, no! 

964
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:34,280
I think it's a magnificent construction. The flavour of the ginger is coming through, 

965
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,800
- but not strongly enough for me.
- OK. 

966
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,840
The whole colour of the bake is the same 

967
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,320
and, overall, you've come up with something that is spectacular. 

968
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,640
- You've really lifted your game. 
- Thank you.
- And you had to. 

969
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,080
- Yeah, I did.
- And you've done it. 
- Thank you. 

970
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,880
It's a bit much for me, to be honest. 

971
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,760
It's like knifing Walt Disney. 

972
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,400
It's a very crisp gingerbread. 

973
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,840
- Probably a little bit too spicy. 
- OK. 

974
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,800
And I'm somewhat disappointed 

975
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,680
that we've got a breakfast cereal as the tiles. 

976
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,520
We know how creative you are. 

977
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,160
You could have taken it to another level. 

978
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,280
To create something that's probably a bit more 

979
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,960
structurally demanding. 

980
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,040
Right. 

981
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,920
It could probably have been a bit straighter. 

982
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,920
It's an interesting flavour. 

983
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,040
The biscuit's softening up quite dramatically. 

984
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,920
You can feel the biscuit softening up. 

985
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,480
It probably needed a little bit longer in the oven. 

986
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,600
- It's more sort of cookie gingerbread, which I like.
- Yeah. 

987
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,240
It's a very bold construction. 

988
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:59,840
You've done well to get that structure in one piece and still standing. 

989
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,320
Cathryn. There is no doubt this is Buckingham Palace. 

990
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,200
It doesn't look exactly as I would have hoped. 

991
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,560
Interesting flavour. 

992
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:22,360
- Is that chocolate and ginger? 
- Yeah. And orange. 

993
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,560
It needs to choose one and run with it. 

994
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,120
It looks stunning from the front. 

995
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,600
All those windows. You were so brave to do it so tall. 

996
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,720
- I like the flavour of the chocolate, ginger and orange. I think it's good.
- Thank you. 

997
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:48,480
That looks amazing. There are even cobwebs here. 

998
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,520
I was under the understanding it was meant to be finished with a barn. 

999
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:56,920
No it wasn't. This is exactly how I intended. It's a piece of modern art. 

1000
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,760
Now we've got a door. We didn't have a door before. 

1001
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,000
This is the only one you couldn't get in. 

1002
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:10,800
That biscuit, the ginger is superb. 

1003
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,760
And the cake's part of it, too? 

1004
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,360
Yeah, not a biscuit, technically, but, you know. 

1005
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:20,320
Everything that you eat as part of this is absolutely delicious. 

1006
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,400
You'd be able to eat it till the last crumb. 

1007
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:27,000
I wonder how many of the others we would enjoy eating to the last part. 

1008
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,680
If that's the look you were going for, top marks. 

1009
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:34,520
If it isn't, I would still give you good marks, 

1010
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:38,200
because the structure that you've built is very tricky to do. 

1011
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,960
- Well done.
- Thanks, James. 
- Thank you so much. 

1012
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,880
It's been an odd birthday. 

1013
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,480
'That was a lovely surprise. What's come over the judges?' 

1014
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,480
Beautiful weather must be getting to them. 

1015
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,520
But which bakers do Paul and Mary feel deserve a place 

1016
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,320
in the semi final of the Great British Bake Off? 

1017
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:04,320
Well of course the Coliseum was absolutely great, technically. 

1018
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,920
Original. 

1019
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,320
I've definitely exhausted myself with the fight this week 

1020
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,640
and I hope they appreciate that. 

1021
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:17,720
But what fun James' was. His flavours were absolutely brilliant. 

1022
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,080
Does Brendan deserve to go in there again? Possibly. 

1023
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:25,440
My aim was to deliver cuteness - Walt Disney-like cuteness 

1024
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,760
in that bake. 

1025
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,640
Whatever he does, he does well. 

1026
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,680
Now, whether you like it or not, it comes down to personal opinion. 

1027
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:36,440
Time has come to cast our minds to who might be leaving. 

1028
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,200
I think we've both actually made our minds up on who's going. 

1029
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,120
At this stage, you have to be prepared to stay or go, 

1030
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,120
because it is a very, very close competition. 

1031
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,360
For once, we're absolutely unanimous. 

1032
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:52,760
We don't want anyone to go, but we've sort of made a decision. 

1033
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,720
This has been a crummy week. 

1034
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:59,400
Yeah, definitely haven't shown what I could have done. 

1035
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,160
Let's focus on the positive 

1036
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,240
and we're going to announce this week's Star Baker. 

1037
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:25,520
Who is somebody who, across all three challenges, 

1038
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,400
has shown excellence in technical ability and also flavours. 

1039
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:35,120
And, amazingly, did not use whisky in any single one of those. 

1040
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:39,760
It's our barn-stormer birthday boy, James, this week's Star Baker. 

1041
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,560
- Well done, James.
- Well done. 

1042
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,600
The next task is more onerous, as you know. 

1043
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,280
Oh God, here we go. 

1044
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,400
But, unfortunately for one of you, the journey has to end today. 

1045
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,400
And so the person leaving us today is... 

1046
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,320
..Cathryn. 

1047
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:15,240
We're going to really, really, really miss you. 

1048
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:19,320
- Thanks.
- We're going to miss you so much. It's ludicrous. 

1049
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,240
Come and have a Mel and Sue sandwich. Come on. 

1050
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,240
- Yes, please.
- It's a scary thought, but there you go.
- Very unpleasant. 

1051
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:32,480
I am... not surprised, 

1052
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,880
little bit heartbroken, 

1053
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,040
but it's been the best thing ever. 

1054
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:46,360
- Seriously, you're so good. 
- You are. 

1055
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:52,640
Sadly, it was Cathryn's turn to go. She's done magnificently up to now, 

1056
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,680
but sometimes things just don't go right. 

1057
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,440
I am bloody proud of you and you... 

1058
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,360
My daughter will be disappointed, 

1059
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,800
cos she thinks that her mum is the best at everything, 

1060
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,440
so she thought I was going to win. 

1061
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,040
But my son will be so happy that I'm not in it any more, 

1062
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,920
cos he just wants me to be back at home. 

1063
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,720
'I'm glad that I'm through, but I'm just' 

1064
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,760
absolutely gutted that Cathryn's going home. 

1065
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,200
In terms of this competition and in terms of anyone who enters 

1066
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,840
this competition, Star Baker on their birthday would be, you know, 

1067
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,560
their ultimate dream. 

1068
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,480
Maybe they only gave it to me because it was my birthday. 

1069
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,440
'Everybody left now, going into the semi finals, has been Star Baker.' 

1070
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:38,160
Danny, John, James and Brendan. 

1071
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:42,720
Next week it's going to be extremely difficult for both them and us. 

1072
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,600
This competition has thrown me in at the deep end, but I've been 

1073
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,360
kicking and kicking and kicking and I think I'm still swimming. 

1074
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:52,680
I think now everything you do is going to be so closely scrutinised. 

1075
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,960
You know, one mistake could literally mean 

1076
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,720
you lose your place in the final. 

1077
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,720
So, I'm going to give it a real go. 

1078
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,480
'Next time...' 

1079
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,600
- Worst comes to the worst, you've got a couple of perfect breasts.
- Oui. 

1080
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,680
'..it's a French semi final...' 

1081
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,080
There's nothing I can do. Everything's just gone to pot. 

1082
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,760
'..with signature petit four...' 

1083
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,920
I've got a whole chilli in here. Not sure how wise that was. 

1084
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:22,200
'..a technical challenge straight from a French patisserie.' 

1085
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,480
You could hear a penny drop. 

1086
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,760
'..and choux pastry show stoppers.' 

1087
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,840
My creme pat's got cellulite at the moment. 

1088
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:33,680
'But one baker will fall at the final hurdle.' 

1089
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,440
The person who will not be joining us 

1090
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,640
next week for the Great British Bake Off final is... 

1091
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,960
